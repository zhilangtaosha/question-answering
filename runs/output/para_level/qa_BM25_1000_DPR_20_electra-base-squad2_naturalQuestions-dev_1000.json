They are associated with palpable nodules in taut bands of muscle fibers . They are a topic of ongoing controversy , as there is limited data to inform a scientific understanding of the phenomenon . Accordingly , a formal acceptance of myofascial `` knots '' as an identifiable source of pain is more common among bodyworkers , physical therapists , chiropractors , and osteopathic practitioners . Nonetheless , the concept of trigger points provides a framework which may be used to help address certain musculoskeletal pain .", "hyperirritable spots in the fascia surrounding skeletal muscle", "Trigger points form only in muscles . They form as a local contraction in a small number of muscle fibers in a larger muscle or muscle bundle . These in turn can pull on tendons and ligaments associated with the muscle and can cause pain deep within a joint where there are no muscles . The integrated hypothesis theory states that trigger points form from excessive release of acetylcholine which produces sustained depolarization of muscle fibers . Indeed , the trigger point has an abnormal biochemical composition with elevated concentrations of acetylcholine , noradrenaline and serotonin and a lower pH . These sustained contractions of muscle sarcomeres compresses local blood supply restricting the energy needs of the local region . This crisis of energy produces sensitizing substances that interact with some nociceptive ( pain ) nerves traversing in the local region which in turn can produce localized pain within the muscle at the neuromuscular junction ( Travell and Simons 1999 ) . When trigger points are present in muscles there is often pain and weakness in the associated structures . These pain patterns in muscles follow specific nerve pathways and have been readily mapped to allow for identification of the causative pain factor .

Francisco 49ers ( 5 -- 1 ) have five wins . New England has the most Super Bowl appearances with ten , while the Buffalo Bills ( 0 -- 4 ) have the most consecutive appearances with four ( all losses ) from 1990 to 1993 . The Miami Dolphins are the only other team to have at least three consecutive appearances : 1972 -- 1974 . The Denver Broncos ( 3 -- 5 ) and Patriots have each lost a record five Super Bowls . The Minnesota Vikings ( 0 -- 4 ) and the Bills have lost four . The record for consecutive wins is two and is shared by seven franchises : the Green Bay Packers ( 1966 -- 1967 ) , the Miami Dolphins ( 1972 -- 1973 ) , the Pittsburgh Steelers ( 1974 -- 1975 and 1978 -- 1979 , the only team to accomplish this feat twice ) , the San Francisco 49ers ( 1988 -- 1989 ) , the Dallas Cowboys ( 1992 -- 1993 ) , the Denver Broncos ( 1997 -- 1998 ) , and the New England Patriots ( 2003 -- 2004 ) . Among those , Dallas ( 1992 -- 1993 ; 1995 ) and New England ( 2001 ; 2003 -- 2004 ) are the only teams to win three out of four consecutive Super Bowls . The 1972 Dolphins capped off the only perfect season in NFL history with their victory in Super Bowl VII . The only team with multiple Super Bowl appearances and no losses is the Baltimore Ravens , who in winning Super Bowl XLVII defeated and replaced the 49ers in that position . Four current NFL teams have never appeared in a Super Bowl , including franchise relocations and renaming : the Cleveland Browns , Detroit Lions , Jacksonville Jaguars , and Houston Texans , though both the Browns ( 1964 ) and Lions ( 1957 ) had won NFL championship games prior to the creation of the Super Bowl .", "Appearances Team Wins Losses Winning percentage Seasons 10A - 05W - 01YA - 02YW !

The Population Health concept represents a change in the focus from the individual - level , characteristic of most mainstream medicine . It also seeks to complement the classic efforts of public health agencies by addressing a broader range of factors shown to impact the health of different populations . The World Health Organization 's Commission on Social Determinants of Health , reported in 2008 , that the SDOH factors were responsible for the bulk of diseases and injuries and these were the major causes of health inequities in all countries . In the US , SDOH were estimated to account for 70 % of avoidable mortality ."], "bm25_ranks": [], "dense_ranks": [], "f1": 0, "p": 0, "r": 0, "em": 0.0, "t": 41.960678815841675}, {"question_id": "https://en.wikipedia.org//w/index.php?title=List_of_Diary_of_a_Wimpy_Kid_characters&amp;oldid=836911164", "question": "who plays manny in diary of a wimpy kid", "pred_answers": ["Connor and Owen Fielding"], "gold_answers": ["Wyatt and Dylan Walters", "Connor and Owen Fielding", "Manuel `` Manny '' Heffley is Greg and Rodrick 's younger brother .

This is very common for cells that are fully differentiated . Cellular senescence occurs in response to DNA damage and external stress and usually constitutes an arrest in G. Some cells enter the G phase semi-permanently and are considered post-mitotic , e.g. , some liver , kidney , and stomach cells . Many cells do not enter G and continue to divide throughout an organism 's life , e.g. , epithelial cells .", "State Phase Abbreviation Description Resting Gap 0 A phase where the cell has left the cycle and has stopped dividing . Interphase Gap 1 Cells increase in size in Gap 1 . The G checkpoint control mechanism ensures that everything is ready for DNA synthesis . Synthesis DNA replication occurs during this phase . Gap 2 During the gap between DNA synthesis and mitosis , the cell will continue to grow . The G checkpoint control mechanism ensures that everything is ready to enter the M ( mitosis ) phase and divide . Cell division Mitosis Cell growth stops at this stage and cellular energy is focused on the orderly division into two daughter cells . A checkpoint in the middle of mitosis ( Metaphase Checkpoint ) ensures that the cell is ready to complete cell division ."], "bm25_ranks": [1, 132, 390, 15, 17, 273, 149, 406, 152, 153, 158, 414, 927, 33, 421, 441, 698, 61, 318, 324, 454, 587, 463, 591, 226, 488, 110, 112, 114, 883, 119, 124, 637], "dense_ranks": [17, 338, 221, 839, 334, 285, 67, 11, 358, 53, 270, 55, 165, 167, 412, 75, 601, 22, 61, 81, 384, 41, 187, 775, 162, 687, 744, 49, 595, 293, 326, 511, 47], "f1": 0.16666666666666669, "p": 0.5, "r": 0.1, "em": 0.0, "t": 46.16660189628601}, {"question_id": "https://en.wikipedia.org//w/index.php?title=Egyptian_hieroglyphs&amp;oldid=837798118", "question": "what type of writing did ancient egypt use", "pred_answers": ["hieroglyphs."], "gold_answers": ["hieroglyphs", "Egyptian hieroglyphs ( / Ààha…™r…ôÀå…°l…™f , - ro ä - / ) were the formal writing system used in Ancient Egypt .

There never was a bishop in colonial Virginia , and in practice the local vestry consisting of laymen controlled the parish .", "The history of religion in early Virginia begins with the commencing of Anglican services in Jamestown 1607 , which became the established church in 1619 , and culminates with the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom in 1786 .", "The Church of England", "Anglican church", "In the 1740s , the established Anglican church had about 70 parish priests around the colony . There was no bishop , and indeed , there was fierce political opposition to having a bishop in the colony . The Anglican priests were supervised directly by the Bishop of London .

It is the instinctive response for the body to stop bleeding and loss of blood . During hemostasis three steps occur in a rapid sequence . Vascular spasm is the first response as the blood vessels constrict to allow less blood to be lost . In the second step , platelet plug formation , platelets stick together to form a temporary seal to cover the break in the vessel wall . The third and last step is called coagulation or blood clotting . Coagulation reinforces the platelet plug with fibrin threads that act as a `` molecular glue '' . Platelets are a large factor in the hemostatic process . They allow for the creation of the `` platelet plug '' that forms almost directly after a blood vessel has been ruptured . Within seconds of a blood vessel 's epithelial wall being disrupted platelets begin to adhere to the sub-endothelium surface . It takes approximately sixty seconds until the first fibrin strands begin to intersperse among the wound . After several minutes the platelet plug is completely formed by fibrin . Hemostasis is maintained in the body via three mechanisms :", "Hemostasis or haemostasis is a process which causes bleeding to stop , meaning to keep blood within a damaged blood vessel ( the opposite of hemostasis is hemorrhage ) . It is the first stage of wound healing . This involves coagulation , blood changing from a liquid to a gel . Intact blood vessels are central to moderating blood 's tendency to form clots . The endothelial cells of intact vessels prevent blood clotting with a heparin - like molecule and thrombomodulin and prevent platelet aggregation with nitric oxide and prostacyclin . When endothelial injury occurs , the endothelial cells stop secretion of coagulation and aggregation inhibitors and instead secrete von Willebrand factor which initiate the maintenance of hemostasis after injury . Hemostasis has three major steps : 1 ) vasoconstriction , 2 ) temporary blockage of a break by a platelet plug , and 3 ) blood coagulation , or formation of a fibrin clot . These processes seal the hole until tissues are repaired .", "vasoconstriction ,", "Vascular spasm ( Vasoconstriction ) - Vasoconstriction is produced by vascular smooth muscle cells , and is the blood vessel 's first response to injury . The smooth muscle cells are controlled by vascular endothelium , which releases intravascular signals to control the contracting properties . When a blood vessel is damaged , there is an immediate reflex , initiated by local sympathetic pain receptors , which helps promote vasoconstriction . The damaged vessels will constrict ( vasoconstrict ) which reduces the amount of blood flow through the area and limits the amount of blood loss . Collagen is exposed at the site of injury , the collagen promotes platelets to adhere to the injury site . Platelets release cytoplasmic granules which contain serotonin , ADP and thromboxane A2 , all of which increase the effect of vasoconstriction . The spasm response becomes more effective as the amount of damage is increased . Vascular spasm is much more effective in smaller blood vessels . Platelet plug formation - Platelets adhere to damaged endothelium to form a platelet plug ( primary hemostasis ) and then degranulate . This process is regulated through thromboregulation . Plug formation is activated by a glycoprotein called Von Willebrand factor ( vWF ) , which is found in plasma . Platelets play one of major roles in the hemostatic process . When platelets come across the injured endothelium cells , they change shape , release granules and ultimately become ' sticky ' . Platelets express certain receptors , some of which are used for the adhesion of platelets to collagen . When platelets are activated , they express glycoprotein receptors that interact with other platelets , producing aggregation and adhesion . Platelets release cytoplasmic granules such as adenosine diphosphate ( ADP ) , serotonin and thromboxane A2 . Adenosine diphosphate ( ADP ) attracts more platelets to the affected area , serotonin is a vasoconstrictor and thromboxane A2 assists in platelet aggregation , vasoconstriction and degranulation . As more chemicals are released more platelets stick and release their chemicals ; creating a platelet plug and continuing the process in a positive feedback loop . Platelets alone are responsible for stopping the bleeding of unnoticed wear and tear of our skin on a daily basis . This is referred to as primary hemostasis . Clot formation - Once the platelet plug has been formed by the platelets , the clotting factors ( a dozen proteins that travel along the blood plasma in an inactive state ) are activated in a sequence of events known as ' coagulation cascade ' which leads to the formation of Fibrin from inactive fibrinogen plasma protein . Thus , a Fibrin mesh is produced all around the platelet plug to hold it in place ; this step is called `` Secondary Hemostasis '' . During this process some red and white blood cells are trapped in the mesh which causes the primary hemostasis plug to become harder : the resultant plug is called as ' thrombus ' or ' Clot ' . Therefore ' blood clot ' contains secondary hemostasis plug with blood cells trapped in it . Though this is often a good step for wound healing , it has the ability to cause severe health problems if the thrombus becomes detached from the vessel wall and travels through the circulatory system ; If it reaches the brain , heart or lungs it could lead to stroke , heart attack , or pulmonary embolism respectively . However , without this process the healing of a wound would not be possible .", "temporary blockage of a break by a platelet plug", "blood coagulation"], "bm25_ranks": [192, 257, 98, 483, 484, 453, 478, 869, 935, 46, 270, 240, 527, 374, 797, 158, 63], "dense_ranks": [314, 602, 631, 191, 184, 152, 143, 244, 303, 226, 673, 103, 748, 205, 195, 18, 433], "f1": 0.16666666666666669, "p": 1.0, "r": 0.5, "em": 0.0, "t": 46.83696675300598}, {"question_id": "https://en.wikipedia.org//w/index.php?title=Ambulatory_care&amp;oldid=811282488", "question": "ambulatory is a term used in health care to describe", "pred_answers": ["outpatient care"], "gold_answers": ["Ambulatory care or outpatient care is medical care provided on an outpatient basis , including diagnosis , observation , consultation , treatment , intervention , and rehabilitation services .

Cone cells are densely packed in the fovea centralis , a 0.3 mm diameter rod - free area with very thin , densely packed cones which quickly reduce in number towards the periphery of the retina . There are about six to seven million cones in a human eye and are most concentrated towards the macula . The commonly cited figure of six million cone cells in the human eye was found by Osterberg in 1935 . Oyster 's textbook ( 1999 ) cites work by Curcio et al.

His chief advisor was `` Colonel '' Edward House , who was sent on many top - level missions . With the outbreak of war in 1914 , the United States declared neutrality and worked to broker a peace . It insisted on its neutral rights , which included allowing private corporations and banks to sell or loan money to either side . With the British blockade , there were almost no sales or loans to Germany , only to the Allies . The widely publicized German atrocities in Germany Shocked American public opinion . Neutrality was supported by Irish - Americans , who hated Britain , by German Americans who wanted to remain neutral , and by women and the churches . It was supported by the more educated upscale WASP element , led by Theodore Roosevelt . Wilson insisted on neutrality , denouncing both British and German violations , especially those German violations in which American civilians were killed . The German U-boat torpedoed the RMS Lusitania in 1915 . It sank in 20 minutes , killing killed 128 American civilians and over 1000 Britons . It was against the laws of war to sink any passenger ship without allowing the passengers to reach the life boats . American opinion turned strongly against Germany as a bloodthirsty threat to civilization . Germany apologized and repeatedly promised to stop attacks by its U-boats , but reversed course in early 1917 when it saw the opportunity to strangle Britain by unrestricted submarine warfare . It also made overtures to Mexico , in the Zimmermann Telegram , hoping to divert American military attention to south of the border . The German decision was not made or approved by the civilian government in Berlin , the by the military commanders and the Kaiser . They realized it meant war with the United States , but hoped to weaken the British by cutting off its imports , and strike a winning below with German soldiers transferred from the Eastern front , where Russia had surrendered . Following the repeated sinking of American merchant ships in early 1917 , Wilson asked and obtained a declaration of war in April 1917 . He neutralized the antiwar element by arguing this was a war With the main goal of ending aggressive militarism and indeed ending all wars . During the war the U.S. was not officially tied to the Allies by treaty , but military cooperation meant that the American contribution became significant in mid-1918 . After the failure of the German spring offensive , as fresh American troops arrived in France at 10,000 a day , the Germans were in a hopeless position , and surrendered . Coupled with Wilson 's Fourteen Points in January 1918 , the U.S. now had the initiative on the military , diplomatic and public relations fronts .

Grant expressed a wish to see a translation of it and print a few copies to be circulated privately amongst friends . After the discussion , Seton - Karr asked Long to arrange for a translation of the play in English . Michael Madhusudan Dutta translated it under the supervision of Long . Long as the editor cut out some coarse passages and wrote a short prefatory note for the play . When the translation was complete , Seton - Karr ordered printing of five hundred copies in lieu of Grant 's wish of a few copies . Then Long sent the translated manuscripts to Clement Henry Manuel , the proprietor of the Calcutta Printing and Publishing Press to print five hundred copies and the cost came to around Rs. 300 . It was published in April or May 1861 . Unknown to the Lieutenant Governor , Long began sending out the copies in official Government envelopes that had the heading : `` on her Majesty 's Service '' . The translation revealed the nature of the oppression against the indigo planters . It naturally offended the establishment of the play so much that a razing propaganda was started by the Anglo - Indian Press against the publisher and the translator . One of the leading newspapers named The Englishmen and some indigo planters instituted a libel suit against Long and the printer - C.H. Manuel .

The earthquake moved Honshu ( the main island of Japan ) 2.4 m ( 8 ft ) east , shifted the Earth on its axis by estimates of between 10 cm ( 4 in ) and 25 cm ( 10 in ) , increased earth 's rotational speed by 1.8 Œºs per day , and generated infrasound waves detected in perturbations of the low - orbiting GOCE satellite . Initially , the earthquake caused sinking of part of Honshu 's Pacific coast by up to roughly a metre , but after about three years , the coast rose back and kept on rising to exceed the original height of the coast .", "2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami An aerial view of the Sendai region with black smoke coming from the Nippon Oil refinery Tokyo Sendai UTC time USGS - ANSS Date 11 March 2011 ; 7 years ago ( 2011 - 03 - 11 ) Origin time 14 : 46 : 24 JST ( UTC + 09 : 00 ) Local date Local time Duration 6 minutes Magnitude 9.0 -- 9.1 ( M ) Depth 29 km ( 18 mi ) Epicenter 38 ¬∞ 19 ‚Ä≤ 19 '' N 142 ¬∞ 22 ‚Ä≤ 08 '' E Ôªø / Ôªø 38.322 ¬∞ N 142.369 ¬∞ E Ôªø / 38.322 ; 142.369 Coordinates : 38 ¬∞ 19 ‚Ä≤ 19 '' N 142 ¬∞ 22 ‚Ä≤ 08 '' E Ôªø / Ôªø 38.322 ¬∞ N 142.369 ¬∞ E Ôªø / 38.322 ; 142.369 Type Megathrust Areas affected Japan ( shaking , tsunami ) Pacific Rim ( tsunami ) Total damage $360 billion USD Max . intensity IX ( Violent ) Peak acceleration 2.99 g Peak velocity 117.41 cm / s Tsunami Up to 40.5 m ( 133 ft ) in Miyako , Iwate , T≈çhoku Landslides Yes Foreshocks List of foreshocks and aftershocks of the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake Aftershocks 11,450 ( as of 3 March 2015 ) Casualties 15,895 deaths , 6,156 injured , 2,539 people missing Citations * Deprecated See documentation .", "reached heights of up to 40.5 metres ( 133 ft )", "up to 40.5 metres ( 133 ft )", "40.5 metres ( 133 ft )"], "bm25_ranks": [], "dense_ranks": [], "f1": 0.0111731843575419, "p": 0.5, "r": 0.005649717514124294, "em": 0.0, "t": 41.1821346282959}, {"question_id": "https://en.wikipedia.org//w/index.php?title=Carbonyl_group&amp;oldid=838085799", "question": "which classes of organic compounds contain a carbonyl functional group as part of their structure", "pred_answers": ["quinoids"], "gold_answers": ["In organic chemistry , a carbonyl group is a functional group composed of a carbon atom double - bonded to an oxygen atom : C =O .

Females reached 2.6 -- 2.9 m ( 8.5 -- 9.5 ft ) in shoulder heights and weighed up to 4 metric tons ( 4.4 short tons ) . A newborn calf weighed about 90 kilograms ( 200 lb ) . The woolly mammoth was well adapted to the cold environment during the last ice age . It was covered in fur , with an outer covering of long guard hairs and a shorter undercoat . The colour of the coat varied from dark to light . The ears and tail were short to minimise frostbite and heat loss . It had long , curved tusks and four molars , which were replaced six times during the lifetime of an individual . Its behaviour was similar to that of modern elephants , and it used its tusks and trunk for manipulating objects , fighting , and foraging . The diet of the woolly mammoth was mainly grass and sedges . Individuals could probably reach the age of 60 . Its habitat was the mammoth steppe , which stretched across northern Eurasia and North America .", "plant food , mainly grass and sedges , which were supplemented with herbaceous plants , flowering plants , shrubs , mosses , and tree matter", "Food at various stages of digestion has been found in the intestines of several woolly mammoths , giving a good picture of their diet . Woolly mammoths sustained themselves on plant food , mainly grass and sedges , which were supplemented with herbaceous plants , flowering plants , shrubs , mosses , and tree matter . The composition and exact varieties differed from location to location . Woolly mammoths needed a varied diet to support their growth , like modern elephants . An adult of six tonnes would need to eat 180 kg ( 397 lb ) daily , and may have foraged as long as twenty hours every day . The two - fingered tip of the trunk was probably adapted for picking up the short grasses of the last ice age ( Quaternary glaciation , 2.58 million years ago to present ) by wrapping around them , whereas modern elephants curl their trunks around the longer grass of their tropical environments . The trunk could also be used for pulling off large grass tufts , delicately picking buds and flowers , and tearing off leaves and branches where trees and shrubs were present .

( i.e. the primary transcript contains the segments : V-D-J-C - C ) . The primary RNA is processed to add a polyadenylated ( poly - A ) tail after the C chain and to remove sequence between the VDJ segment and this constant gene segment . Translation of this mRNA leads to the production of the Ig M heavy chain protein .", "Each heavy chain and light chain gene contains multiple copies of three different types of gene segments for the variable regions of the antibody proteins . For example , the human immunoglobulin heavy chain region contains 2 Constant ( CŒº and CŒ¥ ) gene segments and 44 Variable ( V ) gene segments , plus 27 Diversity ( D ) gene segments and 6 Joining ( J ) gene segments . The light chains also possess 2 Constant ( CŒº and CŒ¥ ) gene segments and numerous V and J gene segments , but do not have D gene segments . DNA rearrangement causes one copy of each type of gene segment to go in any given lymphocyte , generating an enormous antibody repertoire ; roughly 3 √ó 10 combinations are possible , although some are removed due to self reactivity .", "V"], "bm25_ranks": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36,
