They are associated with palpable nodules in taut bands of muscle fibers . They are a topic of ongoing controversy , as there is limited data to inform a scientific understanding of the phenomenon . Accordingly , a formal acceptance of myofascial `` knots '' as an identifiable source of pain is more common among bodyworkers , physical therapists , chiropractors , and osteopathic practitioners . Nonetheless , the concept of trigger points provides a framework which may be used to help address certain musculoskeletal pain .", "hyperirritable spots in the fascia surrounding skeletal muscle", "Trigger points form only in muscles . They form as a local contraction in a small number of muscle fibers in a larger muscle or muscle bundle . These in turn can pull on tendons and ligaments associated with the muscle and can cause pain deep within a joint where there are no muscles . The integrated hypothesis theory states that trigger points form from excessive release of acetylcholine which produces sustained depolarization of muscle fibers . Indeed , the trigger point has an abnormal biochemical composition with elevated concentrations of acetylcholine , noradrenaline and serotonin and a lower pH . These sustained contractions of muscle sarcomeres compresses local blood supply restricting the energy needs of the local region . This crisis of energy produces sensitizing substances that interact with some nociceptive ( pain ) nerves traversing in the local region which in turn can produce localized pain within the muscle at the neuromuscular junction ( Travell and Simons 1999 ) . When trigger points are present in muscles there is often pain and weakness in the associated structures .

nfl team has won the least super bowls", "pred_answers": ["Marty Schottenheimer,"], "gold_answers": ["The Pittsburgh Steelers ( 6 -- 2 ) have won the most Super Bowls with six championships , while the New England Patriots ( 5 -- 5 ) , the Dallas Cowboys ( 5 -- 3 ) , and the San Francisco 49ers ( 5 -- 1 ) have five wins . New England has the most Super Bowl appearances with ten , while the Buffalo Bills ( 0 -- 4 ) have the most consecutive appearances with four ( all losses ) from 1990 to 1993 . The Miami Dolphins are the only other team to have at least three consecutive appearances : 1972 -- 1974 . The Denver Broncos ( 3 -- 5 ) and Patriots have each lost a record five Super Bowls . The Minnesota Vikings ( 0 -- 4 ) and the Bills have lost four . The record for consecutive wins is two and is shared by seven franchises : the Green Bay Packers ( 1966 -- 1967 ) , the Miami Dolphins ( 1972 -- 1973 ) , the Pittsburgh Steelers ( 1974 -- 1975 and 1978 -- 1979 , the only team to accomplish this feat twice ) , the San Francisco 49ers ( 1988 -- 1989 ) , the Dallas Cowboys ( 1992 -- 1993 ) , the Denver Broncos ( 1997 -- 1998 ) , and the New England Patriots ( 2003 -- 2004 ) . Among those , Dallas ( 1992 -- 1993 ; 1995 ) and New England ( 2001 ; 2003 -- 2004 ) are the only teams to win three out of four consecutive Super Bowls . The 1972 Dolphins capped off the only perfect season in NFL history with their victory in Super Bowl VII . The only team with multiple Super Bowl appearances and no losses is the Baltimore Ravens , who in winning Super Bowl XLVII defeated and replaced the 49ers in that position . Four current NFL teams have never appeared in a Super Bowl , including franchise relocations and renaming : the Cleveland Browns , Detroit Lions , Jacksonville Jaguars , and Houston Texans , though both the Browns ( 1964 ) and Lions ( 1957 ) had won NFL championship games prior to the creation of the Super Bowl .", "Appearances Team Wins Losses Winning percentage Seasons 10A - 05W - 01YA - 02YW !

A genetic study found five genetic clusters from tabbies to be ancestral to wildcats of various parts of the world ."], "bm25_ranks": [5, 6, 391, 529, 660, 279, 666, 166, 175, 176, 945, 182, 55, 310, 822, 703, 457, 729, 857, 101, 117, 759, 250, 125], "dense_ranks": [33, 5, 3, 51, 249, 109, 20, 4, 329, 117, 241, 350, 38, 2, 0, 58, 66, 111, 296, 297, 72, 6, 15, 27], "f1": 0.017391304347826087, "p": 0.5, "r": 0.008849557522123894, "em": 0.0, "t": 42.48563480377197}, {"question_id": "https://en.wikipedia.org//w/index.php?title=Cut_(cards)&amp;oldid=765685952", "question": "do you cut cards to the left or right", "pred_answers": ["left"], "gold_answers": ["typically the player to the dealer 's right", "right", "A common procedure is that after the cards have been shuffled , the dealer sets the cards face - down on the table near the player designated to make the cut , typically the player to the dealer 's right .

By 1636 , his son Hong Taiji began driving Ming forces out of Liaodong and declared a new dynasty , the Qing . In 1644 , peasant rebels led by Li Zicheng conquered the Ming capital , Beijing . Rather than serve them , Ming general Wu Sangui made an alliance with the Manchus and opened the Shanhai Pass to the Banner Armies led by the regent Prince Dorgon , who defeated the rebels and seized the capital . Resistance from the Southern Ming and the Revolt of the Three Feudatories led by Wu Sangui extended the conquest of China proper for nearly four decades and was not completed until 1683 under the Kangxi Emperor ( r . 1661 -- 1722 ) . The Ten Great Campaigns of the Qianlong Emperor from the 1750s to the 1790s extended Qing control into Inner Asia . The early rulers maintained their Manchu ways , and while their title was Emperor , they used `` Bogd khaan '' to the Mongols and they were patrons of Tibetan Buddhism . They governed using Confucian styles and institutions of bureaucratic government and retained the imperial examinations to recruit Han Chinese to work under or in parallel with Manchus . They also adapted the ideals of the tributary system in dealing with neighboring territories .", "Qianlong", "Prince Bao"], "bm25_ranks": [772, 7, 519, 525, 270, 527, 141, 26, 928, 422, 551, 423, 681, 946, 954, 320, 323, 582, 457, 969, 973, 82, 600, 478, 350, 608, 995, 742, 872, 746, 749, 112, 243, 376, 761], "dense_ranks": [225, 202, 701, 906, 144, 105, 167, 58, 528, 781, 76, 984, 546, 576, 44, 539, 459, 966, 309, 731, 179, 0, 625, 551, 880, 176, 305, 242, 233, 444, 821, 268, 112, 616, 388], "f1": 0.0182648401826484, "p": 1.0, "r": 0.009216589861751152, "em": 0.0, "t": 45.2914776802063}, {"question_id": "https://en.wikipedia.org//w/index.php?title=List_of_Girl_Meets_World_characters&amp;oldid=819346333", "question": "who plays the dad in girl meets world", "pred_answers": ["Mr. Feeny"], "gold_answers": ["Ben Savage", "Cory Matthews ( Ben Savage ) is Riley and Auggie 's father and Topanga 's husband .

It is the instinctive response for the body to stop bleeding and loss of blood . During hemostasis three steps occur in a rapid sequence . Vascular spasm is the first response as the blood vessels constrict to allow less blood to be lost . In the second step , platelet plug formation , platelets stick together to form a temporary seal to cover the break in the vessel wall . The third and last step is called coagulation or blood clotting . Coagulation reinforces the platelet plug with fibrin threads that act as a `` molecular glue '' . Platelets are a large factor in the hemostatic process . They allow for the creation of the `` platelet plug '' that forms almost directly after a blood vessel has been ruptured . Within seconds of a blood vessel 's epithelial wall being disrupted platelets begin to adhere to the sub-endothelium surface . It takes approximately sixty seconds until the first fibrin strands begin to intersperse among the wound . After several minutes the platelet plug is completely formed by fibrin . Hemostasis is maintained in the body via three mechanisms :", "Hemostasis or haemostasis is a process which causes bleeding to stop , meaning to keep blood within a damaged blood vessel ( the opposite of hemostasis is hemorrhage ) . It is the first stage of wound healing . This involves coagulation , blood changing from a liquid to a gel . Intact blood vessels are central to moderating blood 's tendency to form clots . The endothelial cells of intact vessels prevent blood clotting with a heparin - like molecule and thrombomodulin and prevent platelet aggregation with nitric oxide and prostacyclin . When endothelial injury occurs , the endothelial cells stop secretion of coagulation and aggregation inhibitors and instead secrete von Willebrand factor which initiate the maintenance of hemostasis after injury . Hemostasis has three major steps : 1 ) vasoconstriction , 2 ) temporary blockage of a break by a platelet plug , and 3 ) blood coagulation , or formation of a fibrin clot . These processes seal the hole until tissues are repaired .", "vasoconstriction ,", "Vascular spasm ( Vasoconstriction ) - Vasoconstriction is produced by vascular smooth muscle cells , and is the blood vessel 's first response to injury . The smooth muscle cells are controlled by vascular endothelium , which releases intravascular signals to control the contracting properties . When a blood vessel is damaged , there is an immediate reflex , initiated by local sympathetic pain receptors , which helps promote vasoconstriction . The damaged vessels will constrict ( vasoconstrict ) which reduces the amount of blood flow through the area and limits the amount of blood loss . Collagen is exposed at the site of injury , the collagen promotes platelets to adhere to the injury site . Platelets release cytoplasmic granules which contain serotonin , ADP and thromboxane A2 , all of which increase the effect of vasoconstriction . The spasm response becomes more effective as the amount of damage is increased . Vascular spasm is much more effective in smaller blood vessels . Platelet plug formation - Platelets adhere to damaged endothelium to form a platelet plug ( primary hemostasis ) and then degranulate . This process is regulated through thromboregulation . Plug formation is activated by a glycoprotein called Von Willebrand factor ( vWF ) , which is found in plasma . Platelets play one of major roles in the hemostatic process . When platelets come across the injured endothelium cells , they change shape , release granules and ultimately become ' sticky ' . Platelets express certain receptors , some of which are used for the adhesion of platelets to collagen . When platelets are activated , they express glycoprotein receptors that interact with other platelets , producing aggregation and adhesion . Platelets release cytoplasmic granules such as adenosine diphosphate ( ADP ) , serotonin and thromboxane A2 . Adenosine diphosphate ( ADP ) attracts more platelets to the affected area , serotonin is a vasoconstrictor and thromboxane A2 assists in platelet aggregation , vasoconstriction and degranulation . As more chemicals are released more platelets stick and release their chemicals ; creating a platelet plug and continuing the process in a positive feedback loop . Platelets alone are responsible for stopping the bleeding of unnoticed wear and tear of our skin on a daily basis . This is referred to as primary hemostasis . Clot formation - Once the platelet plug has been formed by the platelets , the clotting factors ( a dozen proteins that travel along the blood plasma in an inactive state ) are activated in a sequence of events known as ' coagulation cascade ' which leads to the formation of Fibrin from inactive fibrinogen plasma protein . Thus , a Fibrin mesh is produced all around the platelet plug to hold it in place ; this step is called `` Secondary Hemostasis '' .

Also , individuals that have high openness tend to lean towards being artists or writers in regards to being creative and appreciate of the significance of the intellectual and artistic pursuits . Moreover , individuals with high openness are said to pursue self - actualization specifically by seeking out intense , euphoric experiences . Conversely , those with low openness seek to gain fulfillment through perseverance and are characterized as pragmatic and data - driven -- sometimes even perceived to be dogmatic and closed - minded . Some disagreement remains about how to interpret and contextualize the openness factor . Conscientiousness ( efficient / organized vs. easy - going / careless ) . A tendency to be organized and dependable , show self - discipline , act dutifully , aim for achievement , and prefer planned rather than spontaneous behavior .

His chief advisor was `` Colonel '' Edward House , who was sent on many top - level missions . With the outbreak of war in 1914 , the United States declared neutrality and worked to broker a peace . It insisted on its neutral rights , which included allowing private corporations and banks to sell or loan money to either side . With the British blockade , there were almost no sales or loans to Germany , only to the Allies . The widely publicized German atrocities in Germany Shocked American public opinion . Neutrality was supported by Irish - Americans , who hated Britain , by German Americans who wanted to remain neutral , and by women and the churches . It was supported by the more educated upscale WASP element , led by Theodore Roosevelt . Wilson insisted on neutrality , denouncing both British and German violations , especially those German violations in which American civilians were killed . The German U-boat torpedoed the RMS Lusitania in 1915 . It sank in 20 minutes , killing killed 128 American civilians and over 1000 Britons . It was against the laws of war to sink any passenger ship without allowing the passengers to reach the life boats . American opinion turned strongly against Germany as a bloodthirsty threat to civilization . Germany apologized and repeatedly promised to stop attacks by its U-boats , but reversed course in early 1917 when it saw the opportunity to strangle Britain by unrestricted submarine warfare . It also made overtures to Mexico , in the Zimmermann Telegram , hoping to divert American military attention to south of the border . The German decision was not made or approved by the civilian government in Berlin , the by the military commanders and the Kaiser . They realized it meant war with the United States , but hoped to weaken the British by cutting off its imports , and strike a winning below with German soldiers transferred from the Eastern front , where Russia had surrendered . Following the repeated sinking of American merchant ships in early 1917 , Wilson asked and obtained a declaration of war in April 1917 . He neutralized the antiwar element by arguing this was a war With the main goal of ending aggressive militarism and indeed ending all wars . During the war the U.S. was not officially tied to the Allies by treaty , but military cooperation meant that the American contribution became significant in mid-1918 .

His view concurred with Dinabandhu Mitra who expressed his sentiments in a play entitled Nil Darpan ( the original Bengali play was written by him ) and published anonymously from Dhaka in 1860 . Mitra sent Long a copy of the play as early as 1861 . Long brought it to the notice of W. S Seton - Karr , Secretary to the Governor of Bengal and ex-President of the Indigo Commission . Seton - Karr , sensing its importance , mentioned Nil Durpan in conversation with the Lieutenant Governor , Grant. Grant expressed a wish to see a translation of it and print a few copies to be circulated privately amongst friends . After the discussion , Seton - Karr asked Long to arrange for a translation of the play in English . Michael Madhusudan Dutta translated it under the supervision of Long . Long as the editor cut out some coarse passages and wrote a short prefatory note for the play . When the translation was complete , Seton - Karr ordered printing of five hundred copies in lieu of Grant 's wish of a few copies . Then Long sent the translated manuscripts to Clement Henry Manuel , the proprietor of the Calcutta Printing and Publishing Press to print five hundred copies and the cost came to around Rs. 300 . It was published in April or May 1861 . Unknown to the Lieutenant Governor , Long began sending out the copies in official Government envelopes that had the heading : `` on her Majesty 's Service '' . The translation revealed the nature of the oppression against the indigo planters . It naturally offended the establishment of the play so much that a razing propaganda was started by the Anglo - Indian Press against the publisher and the translator . One of the leading newspapers named The Englishmen and some indigo planters instituted a libel suit against Long and the printer - C.H. Manuel . The words mentioned in Long 's Introduction to the play stated that what was presented in it was `` plain but true '' .

Only 0.8 % of the energy generated in the Sun comes from the CNO cycle , though this proportion is expected to increase as the Sun becomes older ."], "bm25_ranks": [], "dense_ranks": [], "f1": 0.6666666666666665, "p": 0.75, "r": 0.6, "em": 0.0, "t": 42.973838090896606}, {"question_id": "https://en.wikipedia.org//w/index.php?title=Great_Plague_of_London&amp;oldid=819516144", "question": "when did the great plague of london start and end", "pred_answers": ["1665"], "gold_answers": ["1666", "from 1665 to 1666", "The Great Plague , lasting from 1665 to 1666 , was the last major epidemic of the bubonic plague to occur in England .

The controlled synthesis of materials as thin films ( a process referred to as deposition ) is a fundamental step in many applications . A familiar example is the household mirror , which typically has a thin metal coating on the back of a sheet of glass to form a reflective interface . The process of silvering was once commonly used to produce mirrors , while more recently the metal layer is deposited using techniques such as sputtering .
