They form as a local contraction in a small number of muscle fibers in a larger muscle or muscle bundle . These in turn can pull on tendons and ligaments associated with the muscle and can cause pain deep within a joint where there are no muscles . The integrated hypothesis theory states that trigger points form from excessive release of acetylcholine which produces sustained depolarization of muscle fibers . Indeed , the trigger point has an abnormal biochemical composition with elevated concentrations of acetylcholine , noradrenaline and serotonin and a lower pH . These sustained contractions of muscle sarcomeres compresses local blood supply restricting the energy needs of the local region . This crisis of energy produces sensitizing substances that interact with some nociceptive ( pain ) nerves traversing in the local region which in turn can produce localized pain within the muscle at the neuromuscular junction ( Travell and Simons 1999 ) . When trigger points are present in muscles there is often pain and weakness in the associated structures . These pain patterns in muscles follow specific nerve pathways and have been readily mapped to allow for identification of the causative pain factor . Many trigger points have pain patterns that overlap , and some create reciprocal cyclic relationships that need to be treated extensively to remove them .", "muscles", "hyperirritable spots in the fascia surrounding skeletal muscle", "in the fascia surrounding skeletal muscle", "Myofascial trigger points , also known as trigger points , are described as hyperirritable spots in the fascia surrounding skeletal muscle .

The only team with multiple Super Bowl appearances and no losses is the Baltimore Ravens , who in winning Super Bowl XLVII defeated and replaced the 49ers in that position .

It is the instinctive response for the body to stop bleeding and loss of blood . During hemostasis three steps occur in a rapid sequence . Vascular spasm is the first response as the blood vessels constrict to allow less blood to be lost . In the second step , platelet plug formation , platelets stick together to form a temporary seal to cover the break in the vessel wall . The third and last step is called coagulation or blood clotting . Coagulation reinforces the platelet plug with fibrin threads that act as a `` molecular glue '' . Platelets are a large factor in the hemostatic process . They allow for the creation of the `` platelet plug '' that forms almost directly after a blood vessel has been ruptured . Within seconds of a blood vessel 's epithelial wall being disrupted platelets begin to adhere to the sub-endothelium surface . It takes approximately sixty seconds until the first fibrin strands begin to intersperse among the wound . After several minutes the platelet plug is completely formed by fibrin . Hemostasis is maintained in the body via three mechanisms :", "temporary blockage of a break by a platelet plug", "Vascular spasm ( Vasoconstriction ) - Vasoconstriction is produced by vascular smooth muscle cells , and is the blood vessel 's first response to injury . The smooth muscle cells are controlled by vascular endothelium , which releases intravascular signals to control the contracting properties . When a blood vessel is damaged , there is an immediate reflex , initiated by local sympathetic pain receptors , which helps promote vasoconstriction . The damaged vessels will constrict ( vasoconstrict ) which reduces the amount of blood flow through the area and limits the amount of blood loss . Collagen is exposed at the site of injury , the collagen promotes platelets to adhere to the injury site . Platelets release cytoplasmic granules which contain serotonin , ADP and thromboxane A2 , all of which increase the effect of vasoconstriction . The spasm response becomes more effective as the amount of damage is increased . Vascular spasm is much more effective in smaller blood vessels . Platelet plug formation - Platelets adhere to damaged endothelium to form a platelet plug ( primary hemostasis ) and then degranulate . This process is regulated through thromboregulation . Plug formation is activated by a glycoprotein called Von Willebrand factor ( vWF ) , which is found in plasma . Platelets play one of major roles in the hemostatic process . When platelets come across the injured endothelium cells , they change shape , release granules and ultimately become ' sticky ' . Platelets express certain receptors , some of which are used for the adhesion of platelets to collagen . When platelets are activated , they express glycoprotein receptors that interact with other platelets , producing aggregation and adhesion . Platelets release cytoplasmic granules such as adenosine diphosphate ( ADP ) , serotonin and thromboxane A2 . Adenosine diphosphate ( ADP ) attracts more platelets to the affected area , serotonin is a vasoconstrictor and thromboxane A2 assists in platelet aggregation , vasoconstriction and degranulation . As more chemicals are released more platelets stick and release their chemicals ; creating a platelet plug and continuing the process in a positive feedback loop . Platelets alone are responsible for stopping the bleeding of unnoticed wear and tear of our skin on a daily basis . This is referred to as primary hemostasis . Clot formation - Once the platelet plug has been formed by the platelets , the clotting factors ( a dozen proteins that travel along the blood plasma in an inactive state ) are activated in a sequence of events known as ' coagulation cascade ' which leads to the formation of Fibrin from inactive fibrinogen plasma protein . Thus , a Fibrin mesh is produced all around the platelet plug to hold it in place ; this step is called `` Secondary Hemostasis '' . During this process some red and white blood cells are trapped in the mesh which causes the primary hemostasis plug to become harder : the resultant plug is called as ' thrombus ' or ' Clot ' . Therefore ' blood clot ' contains secondary hemostasis plug with blood cells trapped in it . Though this is often a good step for wound healing , it has the ability to cause severe health problems if the thrombus becomes detached from the vessel wall and travels through the circulatory system ; If it reaches the brain , heart or lungs it could lead to stroke , heart attack , or pulmonary embolism respectively . However , without this process the healing of a wound would not be possible .", "Hemostasis or haemostasis is a process which causes bleeding to stop , meaning to keep blood within a damaged blood vessel ( the opposite of hemostasis is hemorrhage ) . It is the first stage of wound healing . This involves coagulation , blood changing from a liquid to a gel . Intact blood vessels are central to moderating blood 's tendency to form clots . The endothelial cells of intact vessels prevent blood clotting with a heparin - like molecule and thrombomodulin and prevent platelet aggregation with nitric oxide and prostacyclin . When endothelial injury occurs , the endothelial cells stop secretion of coagulation and aggregation inhibitors and instead secrete von Willebrand factor which initiate the maintenance of hemostasis after injury . Hemostasis has three major steps : 1 ) vasoconstriction , 2 ) temporary blockage of a break by a platelet plug , and 3 ) blood coagulation , or formation of a fibrin clot .

His chief advisor was `` Colonel '' Edward House , who was sent on many top - level missions . With the outbreak of war in 1914 , the United States declared neutrality and worked to broker a peace . It insisted on its neutral rights , which included allowing private corporations and banks to sell or loan money to either side . With the British blockade , there were almost no sales or loans to Germany , only to the Allies . The widely publicized German atrocities in Germany Shocked American public opinion . Neutrality was supported by Irish - Americans , who hated Britain , by German Americans who wanted to remain neutral , and by women and the churches . It was supported by the more educated upscale WASP element , led by Theodore Roosevelt . Wilson insisted on neutrality , denouncing both British and German violations , especially those German violations in which American civilians were killed . The German U-boat torpedoed the RMS Lusitania in 1915 . It sank in 20 minutes , killing killed 128 American civilians and over 1000 Britons . It was against the laws of war to sink any passenger ship without allowing the passengers to reach the life boats . American opinion turned strongly against Germany as a bloodthirsty threat to civilization . Germany apologized and repeatedly promised to stop attacks by its U-boats , but reversed course in early 1917 when it saw the opportunity to strangle Britain by unrestricted submarine warfare . It also made overtures to Mexico , in the Zimmermann Telegram , hoping to divert American military attention to south of the border . The German decision was not made or approved by the civilian government in Berlin , the by the military commanders and the Kaiser . They realized it meant war with the United States , but hoped to weaken the British by cutting off its imports , and strike a winning below with German soldiers transferred from the Eastern front , where Russia had surrendered . Following the repeated sinking of American merchant ships in early 1917 , Wilson asked and obtained a declaration of war in April 1917 . He neutralized the antiwar element by arguing this was a war With the main goal of ending aggressive militarism and indeed ending all wars . During the war the U.S. was not officially tied to the Allies by treaty , but military cooperation meant that the American contribution became significant in mid-1918 . After the failure of the German spring offensive , as fresh American troops arrived in France at 10,000 a day , the Germans were in a hopeless position , and surrendered . Coupled with Wilson 's Fourteen Points in January 1918 , the U.S. now had the initiative on the military , diplomatic and public relations fronts .

His view concurred with Dinabandhu Mitra who expressed his sentiments in a play entitled Nil Darpan ( the original Bengali play was written by him ) and published anonymously from Dhaka in 1860 . Mitra sent Long a copy of the play as early as 1861 . Long brought it to the notice of W. S Seton - Karr , Secretary to the Governor of Bengal and ex-President of the Indigo Commission . Seton - Karr , sensing its importance , mentioned Nil Durpan in conversation with the Lieutenant Governor , Grant. Grant expressed a wish to see a translation of it and print a few copies to be circulated privately amongst friends . After the discussion , Seton - Karr asked Long to arrange for a translation of the play in English . Michael Madhusudan Dutta translated it under the supervision of Long . Long as the editor cut out some coarse passages and wrote a short prefatory note for the play . When the translation was complete , Seton - Karr ordered printing of five hundred copies in lieu of Grant 's wish of a few copies . Then Long sent the translated manuscripts to Clement Henry Manuel , the proprietor of the Calcutta Printing and Publishing Press to print five hundred copies and the cost came to around Rs. 300 . It was published in April or May 1861 . Unknown to the Lieutenant Governor , Long began sending out the copies in official Government envelopes that had the heading : `` on her Majesty 's Service '' . The translation revealed the nature of the oppression against the indigo planters . It naturally offended the establishment of the play so much that a razing propaganda was started by the Anglo - Indian Press against the publisher and the translator . One of the leading newspapers named The Englishmen and some indigo planters instituted a libel suit against Long and the printer - C.H. Manuel .

The entire process is called oxidative phosphorylation , since ADP is phosphorylated to ATP using the energy of hydrogen oxidation in many steps .", "mitochondrial membrane", "An electron transport chain ( ETC ) is a series of complexes that transfer electrons from electron donors to electron acceptors via redox ( both reduction and oxidation occurring simultaneously ) reactions , and couples this electron transfer with the transfer of protons ( H ions ) across a membrane . This creates an electrochemical proton gradient that drives the synthesis of adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) , a molecule that stores energy chemically in the form of highly strained bonds . The molecules of the chain include peptides , enzymes ( which are proteins or protein complexes ) , and others . The final acceptor of electrons in the electron transport chain during aerobic respiration is molecular oxygen although a variety of acceptors other than oxygen such as sulfate exist in anaerobic respiration ."], "bm25_ranks": [0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 13, 14, 16, 19], "f1": 0.026315789473684213, "p": 0.5, "r": 0.013513513513513514, "em": 0.0, "t": 6.203243732452393}, {"question_id": "https://en.wikipedia.org//w/index.php?title=List_of_Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C._records_and_statistics&amp;oldid=836672003", "question": "how many times has psg won champions league", "pred_answers": ["five times."], "gold_answers": ["46", "Competition Pld Win % GF GA GD National Ligue 1 6 44 1652 747 452 453 45.22 2468 1801 667 ! + 667 Ligue 2 68 38 18 12 55.88 133 73 60 ! + 60 Division 3 0 30 17 8 5 56.67 67 27 40 ! + 40 Coupe de France 11 47 220 152 27 41 69.09 437 195 242 ! + 242 Coupe de la Ligue 7 23 66 47 5 14 71.21 122 59 63 ! + 63 Trophée des Champions 7 11 11 6 54.55 17 8 9 ! + 9 Total 32 128 2047 1007 514 526 49.19 3244 2163 1081 ! + 1081 International UEFA Champions League 0 10 88 46 19 23 52.27 158 103 55 ! + 55 UEFA Europa League 0 9 72 32 24 16 44.44 106 62 44 ! + 44 UEFA Super Cup 0 0 0 00.00 9 − 7 ! − 7 UEFA Cup Winners ' Cup 6 38 24 6 8 63.16 66 27 39 ! + 39 UEFA Intertoto Cup 8 5 0 62.50 20 17 ! + 17 Total 27 208 107 52 49 51.44 352 204 148 ! + 148 Overall total 34 155 2255 1114 566 575 49.40 3596 2367 1229 ! + 1229"], "bm25_ranks": [], "f1": 0, "p": 0, "r": 0, "em": 0.0, "t": 6.431589126586914}, {"question_id": "https://en.wikipedia.org//w/index.php?title=Super_Bowl&amp;oldid=837918386", "question": "who decides where the super bowl is played", "pred_answers": ["Tom Brady,"], "gold_answers": ["the NFL", "NFL owners", "The location of the Super Bowl is chosen by the NFL well in advance , usually three to five years before the game .

An adult of six tonnes would need to eat 180 kg ( 397 lb ) daily , and may have foraged as long as twenty hours every day . The two - fingered tip of the trunk was probably adapted for picking up the short grasses of the last ice age ( Quaternary glaciation , 2.58 million years ago to present ) by wrapping around them , whereas modern elephants curl their trunks around the longer grass of their tropical environments . The trunk could also be used for pulling off large grass tufts , delicately picking buds and flowers , and tearing off leaves and branches where trees and shrubs were present .

The woolly mammoth was well adapted to the cold environment during the last ice age . It was covered in fur , with an outer covering of long guard hairs and a shorter undercoat . The colour of the coat varied from dark to light . The ears and tail were short to minimise frostbite and heat loss . It had long , curved tusks and four molars , which were replaced six times during the lifetime of an individual . Its behaviour was similar to that of modern elephants , and it used its tusks and trunk for manipulating objects , fighting , and foraging . The diet of the woolly mammoth was mainly grass and sedges . Individuals could probably reach the age of 60 .

One of the most notable PPNA settlements is Jericho in the Levant region , thought to be the world 's first town ( settled around 8500 BC and fortified around 6800 BC ) . In Mesopotamia , the convergence of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers produced rich fertile soil and a supply of water for irrigation . The civilizations that emerged around these rivers are among the earliest known non-nomadic agrarian societies . It is because of this that the fertile crescent region , and Mesopotamia in particular , are often referred to as the cradle of civilization . The period known as the Ubaid period ( c. 6500 to 3800 BC ) is the earliest known period on the alluvial plain , although it is likely earlier periods exist obscured under the alluvium . It was during the Ubaid period that the movement towards urbanization began . Agriculture and animal husbandry were widely practiced in sedentary communities , particularly in Northern Mesopotamia , and intensive irrigated hydraulic agriculture began to be practiced in the south . Eridu is the oldest Sumerian site settled during this period , around 5300 BC , and the city of Ur also first dates to the end of this period . In the south , the Ubaid period had a very long duration from around 6500 to 3800 BC ; when it is replaced by the Uruk period .", "Mesopotamia", "The term `` cradle of civilization '' refers to locations where , according to current archeological data , civilization is understood to have emerged .

Other civilizations arose in Asia among cultures situated along large river valleys , such as Indo - Gangetic Plain in the Indian subcontinent and the Yellow River in China .

These often provided the first encounter for some settlers with organized religion , and they were important as social venues . The camp meeting was a religious service of several days ' length with preachers . Settlers in thinly populated areas gathered at the camp meeting for fellowship as well as worship . The sheer exhilaration of participating in a religious revival with crowds of hundreds and perhaps thousands of people inspired the dancing , shouting , and singing associated with these events . The revivals followed an arc of great emotional power , with an emphasis of the individual 's sins and need to turn to Christ , restored by a sense of personal salvation . Upon their return home , most converts joined or created small local churches , which grew rapidly . The Second Great Awakening marked a religious transition in society in America . Many Americans from the Calvinist sect emphasized man 's inability to save themselves and that their only way to be saved was from grace from God .", "The revivals enrolled millions of new members in existing evangelical denominations and led to the formation of new denominations . Many converts believed that the Awakening heralded a new millennial age . The Second Great Awakening stimulated the establishment of many reform movements designed to remedy the evils of society before the anticipated Second Coming of Jesus Christ .", "The Second Great Awakening occurred in several episodes and over different denominations ; however , the revivals were very similar . As the most effective form of evangelizing during this period , revival meetings cut across geographical boundaries , and the movement quickly spread throughout Kentucky , Tennessee and southern Ohio . Each denomination had assets that allowed it to thrive on the frontier . The Methodists had an efficient organization that depended on itinerant ministers , known as circuit riders , who sought out people in remote frontier locations .

It is not a crime to carry a weapon under a Target or Hunting permit for other purposes , but if caught or reported the permit will likely be revoked . Concealed carry without any kind of permit must be charged as a felony unless the weapon is unloaded and no ammunition for it is in possession of the person carrying . All permits are valid throughout the state , except in the City of New York , unless validated by the police commissioner of that city , NY Penal Law 400 ( 6 ) . While New York law does not allow issuance of pistol licenses to non-residents , 2013 federal appeals court and State appeals court rulings clarified the residency requirement . This clarification allowed those domiciled outside of the state with a part - time residence in New York to be issued a permit at the discretion of the licensing officer . Assault weapon law ? Yes Yes S 265.00 , S 265.02 Possession of assault weapons is prohibited , except for those legally possessed on January 15 , 2013 and registered with the state by January 15 , 2014 or classified as an antique assault weapon . New York City , Buffalo , Albany , and Rochester have enacted their own assault weapon bans . Law enforcement and retired law enforcement are exempt from the assault weapons ban . Magazine capacity restriction ? Yes Yes § 265.02 Magazine size limited to 10 rounds . Law enforcement and retired law enforcement are exempt from the 10 round limit . Also exempt are antique high - quality magazines if registered to an associated antique assault weapon . Under the NY SAFE Act ( signed on the 15th of January , 2013 by Gov. Andrew Cuomo ) the magazine law was changed . A legal provision that mandated no more than 7 rounds that may be loaded into the magazine was struck down by a federal judge on December 31 , 2013 . Title II ( National Firearms Act ) weapons restricted ? Yes Yes S 265.02 , S 265.02 Ownership of machine guns , suppressors , short - barreled rifles , and short - barreled shotguns are prohibited to the average citizen . Destructive devices are permitted except for rockets with greater than 3 ounces of propellant , which are prohibited . AOW 's are legal to own but are still required to be on a pistol permit . AOW 's disguised as non-firearms are illegal . Open carry ? Yes No S 265.35 , S 265.01 The law is extremely vague on open carry . Open carry in public is not legal in most instances . While no law specifically bans open carry , a license to carry is issued to carry concealed as per penal law 400 . Therefore , pistol permit holders must carry concealed . Open carry permitted while hunting and possibly on one 's own property . Open carry of unloaded long guns is not explicitly prohibited by any law , but is generally not practiced . Castle Doctrine Law ? Yes * Yes * § 35.20 * New York has a castle doctrine law . It allows for the `` use of ( non-lethal ) physical force in defense of premises and in defense of a person in the course of burglary . '' Lethal force is governed under § 35.15 . State preemption of local restrictions ? No No None New York preempts only handgun licensing . Places such as Buffalo , Rochester , Albany , and most notably New York City have put in more restrictive gun laws , such as licensing of long guns and 5 - round magazine limits . Peaceable journey laws ? Yes Yes S 265.10 With certain restrictions ( see below ) , most notably magazines are not exempt . Some law enforcement agencies ( notably the New York State Police ) do not recognize the federal Firearm Owners Protection Act , and may detain or arrest non-residents transporting firearms through New York in accordance with FOPA . Individuals in such situations would then have to use FOPA as an affirmative defense to firearms - related charges in court . Background checks required for private sales ? Yes Yes NY Gen Bus L § 898 ( 2012 ) For firearm transfers between private parties , a licensed dealer must conduct a background check , provide documentation of the check to the New York State Police , and keep a record of the transaction ."], "bm25_ranks": [], "f1": 0.005825242718446601, "p": 0.3333333333333333, "r": 0.002938295788442703, "em": 0.0, "t": 5.759683132171631}, {"question_id": "https://en.wikipedia.org//w/index.php?title=List_of_NBA_teams_by_single_season_win_percentage&amp;oldid=836537280", "question": "who has the best nba record this season", "pred_answers": ["Chicago Bulls"], "gold_answers": ["Houston Rockets", "PCT Diff Team Season Results Notes Coach Regular season Postseason . 890 73 9 39 -- 2 34 -- 7 0 -- 0 10.8 Golden State Warriors 2015 -- 16 Lost in NBA Finals 15 9 11 -- 3 4 -- 6 List ( show ) Most wins in NBA history ( 73 ) Best start in NBA history ( 24 -- 0 ) Best start in NBA history for every number of losses from 1 - 2 and 4 - 9 : ( 29 -- 1 , . 967 ) , ( 36 -- 2 , . 947 ) , ( 48 -- 4 , . 923 ) , ( 55 -- 5 , . 917 ) , ( 62 -- 6 , . 912 ) , ( 68 -- 7 , . 907 ) , ( 69 -- 8 , . 896 ) , ( 73 -- 9 , . 890 ) Most wins in NBA history ( regular season and postseason combined ) ( 88 ) Started 36 -- 0 at home , part of an NBA record 54 - straight home wins dating back to 2014 -- 15 season 28 game winning streak dating back to 2014 -- 15 , second longest in NBA history Most road wins in NBA history ( 34 ) Best road start in NBA history and third longest road winning streak ( 14 -- 0 ) Undefeated November ( 16 -- 0 ) Best record heading into the All - Star Break in NBA history ( 48 -- 4 , 0.923 ) Winning streaks of 24 and 11 games Second earliest clinch of playoff berth in NBA history ( the Warriors beat it by two days in the 2016 -- 17 season ) First team in NBA history to make over 1,000 three - pointers in regular - season Only team in NBA history not to have lost to same opponent twice in regular season Only team in NBA history not to lose back - to - back games in regular season The 10th team in NBA history to win a playoff series coming back from a 1 -- 3 playoff series deficit ( won 4 -- 3 against the Oklahoma City Thunder in the Western Conference Finals ) The 11th team in NBA history to lose a playoff series after taking a 3 -- 1 playoff series lead ( lost 3 -- 4 against the Cleveland Cavaliers in the NBA Finals ) , and the only team to do so in the NBA Finals .

'' ( や ろう ぜ 全 王様 ! 宇宙 一 武道 会 ! ! ) February 5 , 2017 TBA The Present Grand Zenō and Future Grand Zenō are playing a game together in their realm , but both have become bored with their monotonous routine . Meanwhile , Goku heads to a local farmer 's market to sell his produce and get Chi - Chi off his back about making money . On the way home , he is ambushed by some robbers . Goku defeats them , but he is injured in the process . Deciding that he has grown rusty , Goku and Goten decide to train with Whis . They head to the Capsule Corporation building , where Bulma reveals she is pregnant with her and Vegeta 's second child . Goten remains behind to train with Trunks . Vegeta declines to accompany Goku so that he can be with Bulma when she gives birth . Goku heads to Beerus ' planet alone . While training with Whis , Goku remembers Grand Zenō 's intention to hold a multiverse martial arts tournament . Heedless of Beerus and Whis ' warnings , Goku uses Grand Zenō 's button to head to his realm and convinces Present Grand Zenō and Future Grand Zenō to hold the tournament . When he returns to Beerus ' planet , Beerus angrily berates Goku and explains that Grand Zenō naive and innocent nature combined with his extreme power makes him a danger to the multiverse . Beerus threatens to kill Goku if he steps out of line again . Goku , Beerus , and Whis head to the Sacred World of the Kais , where the Grand Minister arrives . He tells the group to assemble their ten most powerful warriors to compete in the `` Tournament of Power '' ( 力 の 大会 , Chikara no Taikai ) . 78 `` The Gods of Every Universe in Shock ? !

It is a place of `` infinite nothingness '' , where the competitors can fight without limits . The tournament champion will be granted a wish by the Super Dragon Balls , while the losers and their respective universes will be completely erased from existence . Everyone is horrified by this harsh penalty . Goku suggests asking Grand Zenō and Future Grand Zenō to ignore it , but Whis advises against this . Whis tells Goku that Grand Zenō and Future Grand Zenō has already made up his mind and attempting to change it could be dangerous . Beerus demands that Goku takes responsibility for asking Grand Zenō and Future Grand Zenō to hold the tournament in the first place . Goku declares that he will defeat any opponent he faces . The Grand Minister also reveals that Universes 7 and 9 are to have a smaller exhibition tournament for Future Grand Zenō 's benefit . Each universe is to name three fighters . Goku sets off to recruit teammates . After Vegeta refuses , Goku recruits Gohan and Majin Buu , who is accompanied by Mr. Satan to represent Universe 7 . Goku also explains the potential penalty to Gohan . Gohan tells Goku to keep the stakes a secret to prevent mass panic . Back at Grand Zenō 's and Future Grand Zenō 's palace , all the gods from all 12 universes gather . The Grand Minister explains the purpose of the Zen Exhibition Match . He alludes to the possibility of Grand Zenō and Future Grand Zenō erasing the fighters that he deems unfit for the tournament . In the first round , Majin Buu is to fight Basil ( バジル , Bajiru ) , a humanoid canine fighter from Universe 9 . 79 `` Universe 9 's Basil the Kicker VS Universe 7 's Majin Buu ! !

Goku goads Basil into showing his full power to get Majin Buu 's attention , which leads to Basil using his ultimate attack . As Roh ( ロウ , Rō ) , the Supreme Kai of Universe 9 , claims victory , Majin Buu emerges with a hole in his stomach , but he is otherwise unmoved . Basil and Roh are shocked to see this . Mr. Satan is injured during the attack . He tells Majin Buu to beat Basil before falling unconscious . This enrages Majin Buu to the point , where he effortlessly beats Basil and knocks him out of the ring . However , since neither Grand Zenō and Future Grand Zenō is satisfied with the fight , Basil is allowed to get back into the ring . Roh gives Basil a drug that makes him far more powerful . Although Beerus demands that Basil is disqualified for obvious cheating , Grand Zenō and Future Grand Zenō is entertained by this and allows the fight to continue . The Grand Minister announces that the rules will be improvised as the tournament goes along . Basil overpowers Majin Buu and seemingly beats him , which causes Roh to prematurely gloat about the superiority of Universe 9 . However , Majin Buu emerges unscathed and launches a full power attack at Basil . This knocks him out and clinches Universe 7 the victory . As the Universe 9 team laments Basil 's loss , Basil 's second oldest brother Lavender ( ラベンダ , Rabenda ) says that if he is allowed to kill his opponent , which Bergamo gives him permission to do , he can win his match . Gohan volunteers to fight Lavender . 80 `` Awaken Your Sleeping Battle Spirit ! Son Gohan 's Fight ! ! '' `` Nemutta tōshi o yobisamase ! Son Gohan no tatakai ! !

Shin offers Gohan a Senzu bean to cure the poison , but Gohan refuses and says he wants to fight with his strength alone . Unable to see , Gohan uses his other senses to track Lavender and scores several blows . Lavender counters by levitating , which eliminates the sound of his footsteps . Gohan responds by powering up to Super Saiyan and bouncing his own ki off of Lavender 's body , which uses it as a kind of active radar . Powering up also causes the poison to spread rapidly through Gohan 's body . Lavender mounts a comeback . In desperation , Gohan grabs hold of Lavender and launches a kamikaze attack . He drives both of their bodies into the ring at high speed . Lavender is knocked out , but Gohan is so weakened by the poison that he can not continue . With both fighters down , the match is declared a tie . After Goku feeds Gohan a Senzu bean , the Grand Minister announces to those in attendance that all universes that lose the Tournament of Power will be erased with their respective gods as well . However , Universes 1 , 5 , 8 , and 12 will be exempt from erasure as will the Angels from all universes because their inhabitants are particularly strong . Grand Zenō and Future Grand Zenō had long believed that there were too many universes . He was planning to erase most of them anyway , but the tournament will afford one of the weaker universes the chance to be spared . With the announcement concluded , the ring is repaired in preparation for the final exhibition match where Goku will fight Bergamo ( ベルガモ , Berugamo ) , Basil 's oldest brother who is also a humanoid canine . 81 5 `` Bergamo the Crusher Vs Son Goku !

He grows stronger and physically larger . Goku continues to attack , which causes Bergamo to grow so large that the ring begins to buckle under his weight . Goku transforms to Super Saiyan Blue , which shocks the gods and quickly overwhelms Bergamo with a Kaioken powered Kamehameha . Bergamo claims every universe participating in the Tournament of Power will seek vengeance on Goku for making them face erasure , but Goku relishes the idea of such a challenge .

Piccolo is able to sense Damon 's attacks , but he proves unable to hit Damon , who knocks him out of the ring and eliminates him . No. 17 discovers the truth and exposes Damon as a tiny bug - like creature rather than an invisible person , which explains why none of the fighters were able to hit him . To solve this problem , Goku repeatedly punches the ring and creates shock waves that launch Damon into the air , which cancels out his agility and allows No. 17 to hit him with energy blasts .

Dyspo reveals his own ultimate technique , the Super Maximum Light Speed Mode , which increases his power and speed even further , and overwhelms Frieza .

In the wake of the explosion , Toppo appears to have been defeated . However , he gets back up and powers up , using the same type of energy as a God of Destruction . Belmod explains that Toppo is a candidate to be Universe 11 's next God of Destruction , which is why he can wield the same kind of power .

However , his abandonment by his surviving friends turned Jiren into a loner who distrusted friendship , and he now focuses solely on increasing his own strength . No. 17 admires Jiren 's human qualities , but he accuses Jiren of using the rest of his universe 's team for his own ends . Jiren rebuffs him and fires a powerful energy blast down at No. 17 , Goku , and Vegeta .

Eren Jaeger , of the town called the Shiganshina District , wishes to see the outside world by joining the Scout Regiment , as he likens living in the cities to livestock . Despite this , his adopted sister Mikasa Ackermann and their mother Carla Jaeger are against him joining the Scouts . Even after seeing the Scouts return home with large casualties , Eren expresses his interest to join , which impresses his father Grisha Jaeger . After Eren and Mikasa rescue their friend Armin Arlelt from a group of delinquents due to his views that the walls will not protect them forever , the Colossal Titan suddenly appears and knocks down the gate to the Shiganshina District , which lies in the outer edge of Wall Maria , allowing smaller Titans to enter . As the town erupts into mass panic , Eren and Mikasa rush back to Carla , only to see her pinned under their collapsed house . Carla begs them to flee , but they refuse until city guard Hannes arrives and takes them away .

Some of townsfolk of the Shiganshina District escape to the inner Wall Maria , while the soldiers try to hold off the Titans . The soldiers try to close the gate , but the Armored Titan rams the gate , breaching the inner Wall Maria , and causing those inside to retreat even further inside Wall Rose . Some time later , Eren has a strange dream in which his grieving father forcefully gives him an injection and his key before being woken up by Mikasa . Eren grows disgusted with the people of Wall Rose as the latter do not like sharing their food or homes with the refugees . During the next year , as a food shortage becomes apparent , the government orders the refugees to either work on the farms or fight to reclaim Wall Maria . About 250,000 people , 20 % of the populace , choose to fight , only to be wiped out by the Titans . Eren vows revenge and joins the army along with Mikasa and Armin . `` A Dim Light Amid Despair : Humanity 's Comeback , Part 1 '' `` Zetsubō no Naka de Nibuku Hikaru - Jinrui no Saiki ( 1 ) - '' ( 絶望 の 中 で 鈍く 光る ― 人類 の 再起 1 ― ) Kiyoshi Fukumoto Hiroshi Seko April 21 , 2013 May 17 , 2014 The drill instructor Keith Sadies inspects the new recruits of the 104th Cadet Corps and provides a barrage of verbal insults . When he comes across Sasha Braus , who is eating a potato , he punishes her by having her run around the camp until sunset and not giving her any food or drink . Eren develops a rivalry with Jean Kirschtein , who desires a safe and easy position in the Military Police Regiment within the inner city walls . The recruits train on an omni - directional mobility gear apparatus , where they have to balance themselves while suspended on cables . After Eren has trouble balancing , he asks Reiner Braun and Bertholdt Hoover for help and discover they too are among the few who have personally encountered Titans . The next day , Eren balances on the apparatus but falls , but Keith discovers that Eren 's apparatus was defective and passes him after a retry with different equipment . `` The Night of the Closing Ceremony : Humanity 's Comeback , Part 2 '' `` Kaisan Shiki no Yoru - Jinrui no Saiki ( 2 ) - '' ( 解散 式 の 夜 ― 人類 の 再起 2 ― ) Makoto Bessho Yasuko Kobayashi April 28 , 2013 May 24 , 2014 Five years since Wall Maria fell , Keith evaluates the recruits for their strengths and weaknesses . After training in hand - to - hand combat with Reiner and Annie Leonhart , Eren learns later that night that Jean and several other recruits hope to join the Military Police Regiment to avoid having to fight Titans . On graduation day , Eren and Mikasa rank among the top ten of their class . They are eligible to join the Military Police Regiment , but Eren declines and announces that he is joining the Scout Regiment on the front lines , leading Armin and Mikasa to join him . They are assigned to the Trost District , one of the cities which is at the outer edge of Wall Rose , where they discover other classmates have joined . The Colossal Titan appears and breaches the gate .

The Military Police Regiment scrambles to evacuate the people of the Trost District and set up defenses before the Titans enter the city . Assigned by Commander Kitts Woerman of the Garrison Regiment to different squads , Mikasa helps with the evacuation , while Eren and Armin provide backup at the front lines . With the Titans now in the city , Eren recalls his lessons that in order to kill a Titan , they must strike the nape of its neck . As Eren and Armin 's squad attack , their comrades are killed or eaten by the Titans one by one , with Eren himself losing his left leg . Armin , paralyzed with fear upon seeing his comrades ' fates , is picked up by a Bearded Titan and almost swallowed . Eren , recalling when he and Armin wished to see the world outside the walls , manages to drag and toss Armin out of the Bearded Titan 's mouth at the last moment . He reaches for Armin with his left arm out of the Bearded Titan 's mouth , but the Bearded Titan closes its jaws , severing Eren 's arm and swallowing him . 6 6 `` The World the Girl Saw : The Struggle for Trost , Part 2 '' `` Shōjo ga Mita Sekai - Torosuto - ku Kōbōsen ( 2 ) - '' ( 少女 が 見 た 世界 ― トロスト 区 攻防 戦 2 ― ) Tomomi Ikeda Hiroshi Seko May 12 , 2013 June 7 , 2014 Armin awakens to find himself surrounded by Conny Springer , Christa Lenz and Ymir . As Armin heads back to the rearguard , he blames himself not being strong enough to save Eren . Meanwhile , an Abnormal Titan approaches the city 's exit gate , which is crowded by refugees .

In the year 844 , a year before the fall of Wall Maria , Mikasa was targeted by three slave traders , who murdered her parents in a struggle . After Grisha and Eren discovered the corpses while making a visit , Eren secretly tracked down the slave traders to a nearby hut and killed two of them in an attempt to save Mikasa . However , the third slave trader appeared and began strangling Eren . Encouraged by Eren , Mikasa overcame her fear and gained resolve to kill the third slave trader . After the children are found by the Military Police Regiment , Mikasa was invited to live with Eren and Grisha . Back in the present , Mikasa slays more Titans and goes to help the other squads evacuate . 7 7 `` Small Blade : The Struggle for Trost , Part 3 '' `` Chiisana Yaiba - Torosuto - ku Kōbōsen ( 3 ) - '' ( 小さな 刃 ― トロスト 区 攻防 戦 3 ― ) Yuzuru Tachikawa Hiroshi Seko May 19 , 2013 June 14 , 2014 The surviving squads , unable to reach the inner walls due to their omni - directional mobility gear being low on gas , lose their fighting spirit as the nearby supply depot is overrun by Titans . Mikasa seems unfazed after learning from Armin that his entire squad perished , including Eren . She rallies the others to reclaim the supply depot , inspiring them to join her in the attack , but Mikasa ends up running out of gas midair and falls into an alleyway . Jean assumes command , but he loses his nerve when he sees some of his comrades being eaten by Titans . As a blonde Titan approaches Mikasa , she prepares to attack with her remaining broken blade , but a Mysterious Titan appears behind her and brutally kills the blonde Titan , much to her confusion . Armin and Conny show up , shocked to witness the Mysterious Titan not only fighting other Titans , but also showing knowledge of their weak point and using hand - to - hand combat techniques , while completely ignoring the humans . Armin gives Mikasa his gas tanks and blades so that she can support the others at the supply depot . Mikasa , however , refuses to leave him behind and ponders on the Mysterious Titan 's strange behavior . 8 8 `` I Can Hear His Heartbeat : The Struggle for Trost , Part 4 '' `` Shinzō no Kodō ga Kikoeru - Torosuto - ku Kōbōsen ( 4 ) - '' ( 心臓 の 鼓動 が 聞こえる ― トロスト 区 攻防 戦 4 ― ) Satonobu Kikuchi Shinpei Ezaki Tatsuma Minamikawa Noboru Takagi May 26 , 2013 June 21 , 2014 With the supply depot swarming with Titans , Armin has the idea of using the Mysterious Titan to defeat them . Mikasa and Conny agree with his plan and defeat the Titans attacking it , before rushing to the supply depot . Meanwhile , Jean and the others reach the supply depot despite suffering more casualties on the way , with Armin , Mikasa and Conny arriving soon after . Armin 's plan works , but while the Mysterious Titan is able to attract the enemies outside , seven smaller Titans remain in the fuel storage area . With their equipment out of fuel , Armin devises another plan . The survivors draw the Titans ' attention to an elevator and shoot them in the eyes to blind them , while seven of them jump from the ceiling to finish them off . Sasha and Conny fail to kill their targets but are saved by Mikasa and Annie . Having successfully replenished their fuel , the soldiers prepare to retreat . As they see the Mysterious Titan defeating all of the other Titans before collapsing , they are shocked to watch Eren emerge from its body . Mikasa reaches Eren and cries upon confirming that he is alive , while Armin notices that Eren 's severed leg and arm have somehow regenerated as well . 9 9 `` Whereabouts of His Left Arm : The Struggle for Trost , Part 5 '' `` Hidariude no Yukue - Torosuto - ku Kōbōsen ( 5 ) - '' ( 左腕 の 行方 ― トロスト 区 攻防 戦 5 ― ) Yoshiyuki Fujiwara Yasuko Kobayashi June 2 , 2013 June 28 , 2014 Captain Levi of the Scout Regiment and his squad successfully retake a town from the Titans until they are called to an emergency at the Trost District as the Titans have invaded the city . When Eren was eaten and swallowed by the Bearded Titan , he found himself in its stomach along with the bodies of its victims . His rage at the Titans caused him to burst out of the Bearded Titan 's stomach by transforming himself into the Mysterious Titan and going on a rampage against them . Although Eren 's comrades saw him emerge from the Mysterious Titan , they all agreed to keep it a secret and bring him back inside Wall Rose . However , Kitts also witnessed this and has his men aim their weapons at Eren . Armin and Mikasa try to defend Eren , but to no avail . As Kitts fearfully orders the cannons to fire on the three of them , Eren recalls hazy memories of his father giving him an injection , telling him to reclaim Wall Maria and go to their home 's basement with his key . In order to protect Mikasa and Armin from the cannons , Eren partially transforms himself into the Mysterious Titan , sheltering them inside his ribs . 10 10 `` Response : The Struggle for Trost , Part 6 '' `` Kotaeru - Torosuto - ku Kōbōsen ( 6 ) - '' ( 応える ― トロスト 区 攻防 戦 6 ― ) Hiroyuki Tanaka Hiroshi Seko June 9 , 2013 July 12 , 2014 Eren climbs out of the partially transformed Titan , telling Mikasa and Armin about the basement in his former house . He believes that it holds the secret to mankind 's preservation and the key to destroying the Titans . Kitts once again orders the cannon to be loaded out of fear . Eren comes up with two plans of escape . The first is for Eren to retreat as the Mysterious Titan and criminalize himself in the eyes of humanity , and the second is to have Armin convince Kitts that Eren is an asset rather than a danger . Armin comes to the conclusion that he can still defend his friends despite being cowardice , deciding to try and talk their way out of being executed . Armin tentatively convinces Kitts , only to have him be overcome by fear and give the order to fire once more . The order is halted when Commander Dot Pyxis and his men intervene , sparing their lives . In return , Pyxis asks Eren if he will transform himself to block the gap in Wall Rose to prevent more Titans from getting in . Eren agrees , regardless of whether or not he will be able to control himself as the Mysterious Titan . 11 11 `` Idol : The Struggle for Trost , Part 7 '' `` Gūzō - Torosuto - ku Kōbōsen ( 7 ) - '' ( 偶像 ― トロスト 区 攻防 戦 7 ― ) Kiyoshi Fukumoto Hiroshi Seko June 16 , 2013 July 19 , 2014 As Armin helps Pyxis 's subordinates coordinate a plan , morale among the troops begin to drop , as some want to desert and be with their families . Pyxis silences everyone by reminding them that if they abandon this chance to finally win against the Titans , they will be subjecting their families to their terror , which convinces the troops to stay . Claiming that Eren is the result of a secret project to turn humans into Titans , Pyxis plans to have most of the troops gather at a far corner of the Trost District to lure most of the Titans away while Eren as the Mysterious Titan carries the giant boulder to seal the hole . Along with Mikasa , Eren will be guarded during the mission by three of the best elites of the Garrison , them being Ian Dietrich , Rico Brzenska and Mitabi Jarnach . As they approach the giant boulder , Rico , who is doubtful of the mission 's success and does not completely trust Eren , reminds him that many lives are at stake .

Eren continues his attack and accidentally incapacitates himself , slumping to the ground . The squad protecting Eren sends up a red flare to signal that the plan has failed , much to the dismay of the troops observing from the wall . As Armin heads toward Eren to investigate , the elite squadron argues and eventually agrees to protect Eren instead of abandoning him , still recognizing him as a valuable military asset . During the operation , Jean is separated from Connie and Annie after his omni - directional mobility gear malfunctions , forcing him to hide from two Titans in a building . Armin reaches the unconscious Eren , but Mikasa calls to him , warning that he is in a dangerous state . Armin plunges his sword into the side of Eren 's neck , which briefly awakens him . As Armin speaks to him of the outside world and reminds him of his promise to kill all the Titans , Eren leaves his dreamlike state and regains control . 13 13 `` Primal Desire : The Struggle for Trost , Part 9 '' `` Genshoteki Yokkyū - Torosuto - ku Kōbōsen ( 9 ) - '' ( 原初 的 欲求 ― トロスト 区 攻防 戦 9 ― ) Masashi Koizuka Noboru Takagi June 30 , 2013 August 2 , 2014 Jean manages to acquire another set of omni - directional mobility gear from a dead soldier and escapes , thanks to Annie , Conny and Marco Bott distracting the Titans . With Eren as the Mysterious Titan carrying the boulder towards the gate , Ian orders everyone to protect Eren from the Titans at all costs . Eren finally blocks the open gate with the boulder , and Rico fires a yellow flare to signal that the operation was a success . As Armin tries to pull Eren from his Titan body , they are cornered by two Titans , but Levi saves them in the nick of time . All Titans remaining in the Trost Districts are eliminated except two , which are captured for research . Jean , Sasha and Annie all mourn the deaths of their fellow comrades among several casualties . Meanwhile , Eren is chained in a cell guarded by the Military Police Regiment , where he is visited by Levi and Commander Erwin Smith of the Scout Regiment .

Eren is brought to a military tribunal to be judged by Commander - in - Chief Dhalis Zachary , who will decide whether Eren should be given to the Military Police Regiment or the Scout Regiment , both of whom have their own reasons for wanting him . The Military Police Regiment wants Eren killed as he is seen by them as a menace , while the Scout Regiment wants to use him to retake Wall Maria . Becoming furious upon hearing from a merchant that Mikasa is accused of being a Titan as well , Eren calls out the Military Police Regiment and their supporters for their cowardice . Levi brutally beats down Eren in retaliation , but Eren does not transform into the Mysterious Titan . Levi uses this to show to the court that the Scout Regiment can control Eren , and proposes that Eren is to be made part of his squad . In the end , Zachary gives Eren to the Scout Regiment , where Erwin and Hange Zoë welcome him . As Eren is getting treatment for his wounds , they discover that he grew back a tooth knocked out after being beaten down by Levi . 15 15 `` Special Operations Squad : Eve of the Counterattack , Part 2 '' `` Tokubetsu Sakusen - han - Hangeki Zen'ya ( 2 ) - '' ( 特別 作戦 班 ― 反撃 前夜 2 ― ) Kiyoshi Fukumoto Hiroshi Seko July 21 , 2013 August 16 , 2014 Levi and his Special Operations Squad , composed of Eld Gin , Oruo Bozad , Petra Rall and Günther Schultz , bring Eren to the old Scout Regiment headquarters , where Eren will learn to control his Titan powers under their watch . As Levi orders the castle to be cleaned , Petra assures Eren that Levi does care about the people under his command despite his rude and harsh demeanor . Meanwhile , Erwin and Miche Zacharius discuss the new recruits joining the Scout Regiment and how they must prove Eren 's usefulness to Military Command within a month . Hange asks Eren to help her in her experiments with the two Titans they have captured , which she named Sawney and Beane . She has an obsession with Titans where she treats them like people despite the many times she puts herself in danger . It is revealed that the Titans need sunlight to survive and their bodies are disproportionately light despite their size . The next day , the Scout Regiment discover that Sawney and Beane have been killed . As Hange mourns for them , the Scout Regiment deduce that the culprit is a soldier who escaped using their omni - directional mobility gear , which makes Eren wonder who their true enemy is . 16 16 `` What Needs to be Done Now : Eve of the Counterattack , Part 3 '' `` Ima , Nani o Subeki ka - Hangeki Zen'ya ( 3 ) - '' ( 今 、 何 を すべ きか ― 反撃 前夜 3 ― ) Keisuke Onishi Yasushi Muroya Yasuko Kobayashi July 28 , 2013 August 23 , 2014 As the recruits are investigated over Sawney and Beane 's deaths , Annie , who will be joining the Military Police Regiment later , gives advice to Armin and Conny that it is their choice to decide on which military division they should join . The 104th Cadets are later greeted by Erwin at the Decision Ceremony , where he tells them that the goal of the Scout Regiment 's expedition on the following month is to reclaim the Shiganshina District and find the secret hidden in Eren 's home basement . After telling the recruits of the Scout Regiment 's high mortality rate during each expedition , Erwin tells the recruits that they may stay and join them or leave to join the other branches .

After Armin 's squad manages to kill an Abnormal Titan , a Female Titan suddenly appears from the right flank at high speed . Much to Armin 's shock , the Female Titan 's body can withstand their blades and is intelligent enough to kill his seniors easily . The Female Titan captures Armin , but after removing his hood and seeing his face , she leaves him alive and continues running . Armin is picked up by Reiner and Jean , who reveals that their right flank was wiped out by the Titans , which makes Armin realize not only was it the Female Titan 's work , but also is she possibly another Titan Shifter like Eren .

Eren starts remembering when he was unable to transform into the Mysterious Titan for experimental purposes in front of Hange , Levi and his squad . During a break when he tried to pick up a teaspoon , Eren suddenly partially transformed , leading Hange to deduce that Eren is able to transform into a Titan not by solely injuring himself but also due to his desire to fulfill his goals . The squad apologized to Eren and told him they should trust each other . Remembering this , Eren decides to trust his squad 's plan . It is then revealed that Levi 's squad is bait to lure the Female Titan into an ambush , where Erwin and his men fire hundreds of grappling hooks to trap the Female Titan .

Meanwhile , the others wonder about what is happening inside the forest , and Levi taunts the Female Titan , prompting her to give a loud scream that draws all Titans in the vicinity to her . Despite the Scout Regiment 's attempt to stop them , the Titans ignore the humans and eat the Female Titan 's body in a frenzy , which makes Erwin call off the expedition .

As well as minting circulating coins for use domestically and internationally , the mint also produces planchets , commemorative coins , various types of medals and precious metal bullion . The mint exports to an average of 60 countries a year , making up 70 % of its total sales . Formed over 1,100 years ago , the mint was historically part of a series of mints that became centralised to produce coins for the Kingdom of England , all of Great Britain and eventually most of the British Empire . The original London mint from which the Royal Mint is the successor , was established in 886 AD and operated within the Tower of London for approximately 800 years before moving to what is now called Royal Mint Court where it remained until the 1960s .

Originally there were fears that the Royal family would face protests because of the Investiture of Prince Charles as the Prince of Wales ; however , such protests failed to materialise . The second phase of construction began in 1973 and included the addition of a means to mint coins from virgin metals completing the full minting process . Upon completion the final cost for the land , buildings and plant came to £ 8 million . Coin minting and production gradually shifted to the new site over the next seven years until the last coin , a gold sovereign , was struck in London in November 1975 . In an attempt to consolidate all previous coin - related acts , the Coinage Act of 1971 was passed , which among other things effectively abolished the individual role of Master of the Mint .

Meanwhile , Shizune gets to know from Sakura that Sarada has awakened her Sharingan a long time ago .

Shin has a unique ability of being transplanted to or injected with anything without any side effects . He also explains why Shin refers to himself as Uchiha , the reason being that he can manifest the Sharingan and is obsessed with the Uchiha name , in particular with Sasuke 's brother , Itachi . On their way out , Sarada asks Suigetsu if he knows the lady in the picture , and he identifies her as Karin . After hearing this , Sarada asks if she is in the hideout , to which Suigetsu replies that she is in another one . Then , Sarada reveals her doubts about her parentage , shocking Suigetsu and making him ask himself if her suspicions could ever be possible . In order to take a DNA test , Suigetsu takes a DNA sample from Sarada and uses what he thinks is Karin 's umbilical cord . The result shows that there is a perfect match , making Suigetsu assume that Karin is Sarada 's mom . Because of this , Sarada feels lied to and fooled by her mother . Realizing how Sarada feels , Suigetsu runs out of the room to prevent further problems . Naruto sees Sarada crying and comes to her . After Sarada manifests the Sharingan , Naruto shows Sarada her eyes in a mirror . He then tells her to calm down and tries to comfort her , but Sarada tells him that he has nothing to do with her and that he can not understand how she feels . Naruto says he is the Hokage and the entire village is his family , which also includes Sarada . Naruto also tells her that the bonds between a parent and a child are not just based on history and blood relations but on the love between them , and he asks Sarada if she can remember any moments that show the love between her and Sakura . Sarada does this and thinks of several such instances , which depict how Sakura was taking care of Sarada when she was sick , how she reassured her about Sasuke 's love for both of them and how she poked her forehead . After remembering all of these moments , Sarada becomes willing to go and save her mother from Shin Uchiha . After both of them leave the room , Suigetsu gets frightened and hides so that Sarada can not see him . Orochimaru comments that Sakura might be dead already , to which Sasuke replies that his wife is not weak . Sasuke then says that his Visual Prowess is recovered and he will take everyone to the hideout in his Susanoo . Sarada and Chocho are amazed by his abilities . In the hideout of Shin Uchiha , Shin plans to revive Akatsuki by killing Sasuke and taking his Sharingan , as he thinks Sasuke is not worthy of the Uchiha name . 23 `` Bonds Come in All Shapes '' `` Tsunagari no Katachi '' ( つながり の カタチ ) September 6 , 2017 As Naruto and the others are coming to save Sakura , she starts fighting Shin after gaining enough information about his evil intentions of reviving Akatsuki . Meanwhile , Naruto and the others get confronted by Shin 's clones upon their arrival at the hideout . Sarada rushes to save Sakura and Sasuke goes after her , while Naruto faces Shin 's clones alone . Shin attacks Sakura with his blades and successfully pierces two blades into her arm , restricting Sakura 's movement . Afterwards , Shin tries to kill Sakura with a giant shuriken , but Sasuke interrupts him and immediately helps Sakura , much to Sarada 's enjoyment . He then goes after Shin , who lost his right leg , but a clone of Shin gets in his way . Instead , Shin stabs Sasuke along with his clone . After Sasuke and Sakura briefly look at each other , Sakura runs to the opposite direction of Shin , who sends his blades after her , but Sasuke changes places with Sakura using his Rinnegan and she finally defeats Shin with a single punch . After that , the clones fighting Naruto come near Shin , but instead of saving him , they stab him with their weapons . They tell him that they are just following Shin 's principles , as his Visual Prowess is no longer powerful , and they believe that it is their turn to get to evolve . Then , several other clones made by the clones themselves come and start fighting Naruto and Sasuke . Shin tries to teleport himself along with Sakura between all the commotion , but Sarada stops him by punching his mysterious creature who has just begun teleporting them , thus showing that she inherited Sakura 's natural control over chakra , much to Sasuke 's pride and Sakura 's surprise . The clone fighting Naruto stops after seeing Kurama inside Naruto , and Naruto promises that they will not attack them if they behave . Sakura hugs Sarada and Sasuke tells Sarada that her existence in the world is the proof of his and Sakura 's connected feelings . Afterwards , all the clones are sent to the orphanage that is run by Kabuto , and upon returning to the village , Chocho sees Choji in his slim form for the first time in her life and her quest to find her real father ends . At Orochimaru 's hideout , Karin explains to Suigetsu that Sarada really is Sasuke and Sakura 's daughter . She scolds Suigetsu for the mistake he made , as she was just the midwife for Sakura when Sakura went into labour , and tells him that the umbilical cord he used for the test is actually the one between Sakura and Sarada . She then urges him to go and apologize to Sarada . Sakura confirms to Sarada along with Sasuke that she is their biological child at the dining table . Next day , Sarada and Sakura see Sasuke off as he leaves for his mission . Before departing , Sasuke pokes Sarada 's forehead and , remembering this gesture from her mother , Sarada turns to Sakura and smiles happily . At the academy , Sarada tells Boruto that she wants to become Hokage in the future . 24 `` Boruto and Sarada '' `` Boruto to Sarada '' ( ボルト と サラダ ) September 13 , 2017 Konoha hosts a summit between the Five Kage , during which Boruto tries to deface his father 's statue once again . Sarada and Sakura place their newly taken family photo in their new home . After this , with her Sharingan now fully unlocked , Sarada trains with Chocho to become Hokage , but she explains that , on her mother 's advice , she plans to keep her new power a secret to avoid being targeted in the future . Konohamaru teaches Sarada more about the Sharingan and tells her she is now his rival toward becoming Hokage . During the summit , Naruto reveals that Sasuke has been using his Rinnegan to investigate the other dimensions and fears that one of them may be harboring dangerous threats . While the other Kage express concern that the new generation of ninja are not cut out for taking on threats should they be faced with a new war , Naruto reveals his belief that the new generation will manage to surpass them . 25 `` A Turbulent Field Trip ! ! '' `` Haran no Shūgakuryokō ! ! '' ( 波乱 の 修学 旅行 ! ! ) September 20 , 2017 With last week 's fear of war still hanging in the air , Naruto hopes to improve relations with the Land of Water by sending his village 's students on a field trip to their Hidden Village . Principal Iruka concurs , and before they know it the students are on a cruise ship en route to the Hidden Mist . To the surprise of the students the Mist has been completely modernized , perhaps even more so than the Leaf , and seeing their amazement in the midst of a different village and culture is undoubtedly entertaining . In typical anime fashion , the girls are charmed by the foreign boys , while the boys are more interested in games and movies . 26 `` The Mizukage 's Successor '' `` Mizukage no Kōkeisha '' ( 水 影 の 後継 者 ) September 27 , 2017 Last week 's instructive foray into the Hidden Mist extends into a class visit to the office of the new Mizukage , Chojuro . Boruto quickly tires of Chojuro 's speech about unity between the villages , which the Kage mercifully cuts short . Kagura continues the Kage 's story later , explaining that Chojuro is the reason for the Mist Village 's recent prosperity . Kagura takes some time to reflect on the `` Blood Mist 's '' dark past , which triggers a rather pertinent outburst from Iwabe . Iwabe tells a story about his grandfather being killed by the Fourth Mizukage , making a point that the Mist should not be so quick to write off their violent history when the war is still fresh in the minds of their victims . 27 `` A Shinobi Bout of Friendship '' `` Yūjō no Shinobi Bauto '' ( 友情 の シノビバウト ) October 4 , 2017 With Kagura 's help , Boruto and his friends manage to save Denki from the Kirigakure 's ninjas led by Hachiya . After this , Kagura confesses to the others that he is the grandson of the 4th Mikuzage , Yagura , and is afraid of wielding his sword which once almost controlled himself to kill his mates . Meanwhile , Shino , Anko and Mei discuss the issues between Kirigakure and the Land of the Water that could create another war . As the Konohagakure boys befriend Kagura , they wonder why did Hachiya take such methods . Happy with having obtained friends , Kagura informs the Mizukage Chojuro . 28 `` A Declaration of War ! '' `` Sensen Fukoku '' ( 宣戦 布告 ) October 11 , 2017 Kagura decides to become one of the Seven Ninja Swordsman of Mist , so he starts practicing with the Hiramekarei sword . Boruto comes to meet him as he calls Boruto to show him the Hiramekarei sword . Boruto congratulates Kagura and assures him that he will become a good leader of the village . As Boruto is praising Kagura , someone suddenly captured them using Water Style . He then release them and Kagura calls him Shizuma . Shizuma tells them his plan to start another war by killing Boruto . Kagura tries to change his mind but instead he makes Kagura reminisce the time when he tried to kill a student at the academy , and Shizuma stopped him . He tells Kagura that the present Mizukage is hiring assassins to kill those who oppose him . After that , Boruto starts fighting Shizuma and when he tries his Lightning Style against him , his subordinates show up to help Shizuma in killing Boruto . Boruto gets pass through his subordinates using a new technique but Shizuma easily defeats him . Kagura saves him from drowning into the water , and Shizuma tells Boruto that he and the others are Seven Ninja Swordsman of Mist and Kagura is also one of them . He then orders Kagura to kill Boruto but instead he points out his sword at Shizuma . Kagura then agrees to join the Shizuma 's group and asks to spare Boruto 's life . Kagura leaves with the others and Boruto faints because of his injuries . When he wakes up , Sarada tells him that Hachiya told her about him . He apologizes to Boruto for his earlier actions . Suigetsu is shown in Kirigakure reveling Shizuma 's full name Shizuma Hoshigaki . He then disappears as soon as Mitsuki shows up . Boruto asks Hachiya about the relation between Kagura and Shizuma , and he tells Boruto that Kagura feels indebted to Shizuma because he hurt him in the past . Sarada plans to tell the teachers about it , but Boruto stops her because he wants to save Kagura himself . Sarada agrees on the condition that he will let her go with him . 29 `` The New Seven Ninja Swordsmen ! '' `` Shin Shinobigatana Shichininshū ! ! '' ( 新 忍 刀 七 人 衆 ! ! ) October 18 , 2017 Boruto and Sarada convince Chojuro to help them take down Shizuma 's gang and save Kagura , but they quickly find out that the `` New Seven Swordsmen of the Mist '' are not to be trifled with . Sarada is hit by an explosive attack that drops her through a deep hole into a cave , where she is confronted by Buntan Kurosaki , who wields the sword Kiba . Sarada 's absence leaves Boruto and Chojuro as the only two remaining to take on Shizuma and the other five . Suigetsu confronts Mitsuki and warns him not to let his origins be revealed by saving Boruto . Shikadai and Inojin eavesdrop on Suigetsu and Mitsuki but are quickly discovered and recruited by Mitsuki to help take down Shizuma . 30 `` The Sharingan vs. The Lightning Blade , Kiba the Fang ! '' `` Sharingan vs Raitō Kiba '' ( 写 輪 眼 vs ( バーサス ) 雷 刀 牙 ) October 25 , 2017 As Buntan begins pressuring Sarada with her array of Lightning Release techniques augmented by the Kiba , Sarada manages to hold her own with her Sharingan . Buntan voices both her excitement and disdain at facing the Sharingan , seeing it as not only an unfair lineage trait but also a shortcut to power . Sarada retorts that Buntan stole the Kiba , but Buntan insists that she earned them and proved to be her father 's child by more than just lineage . As the two continue to clash , with Sarada continuously copying her opponent 's attacks , the Konoha - nin realizes that their constant lightning attacks are heating the water around them and creating a mist . Sarada lures Buntan into the mist with genjutsu and uses the increased hydrogen to set off a large explosion with her paper bomb . Buntan is defeated , but Sarada collapses in exhaustion from excessive usage of her Sharingan . Meanwhile , Kagura fights Boruto and prepares to strike him down ; Chojuro takes down three members of Shizuma 's gang and is nearly ambushed before Iwabe arrives to take down the fourth , but the two get caught up in a large explosion . Elsewhere , Suigetsu gives Mitsuki a scroll , which he believes will help save Boruto . 31 `` Boruto and Kagura '' `` Boruto to Kagura '' ( ボルト と かぐら ) November 1 , 2017 Boruto tries to appeal to Kagura 's common sense , but Shizuma 's influence keeps Kagura on the attack . However , Mitsuki intervenes and reveals the scroll he received from Suigetsu : A signed confession from Shizuma 's benefactors that they were using assassinations to start a new war . With his plan exposed , Shizuma attacks everyone with the Samaheda . Boruto , Kagura and Mitsuki manage to beat Shizuma , but not before the Samaheda fuses with Shizuma to turn him into a monster . Boruto and company overcome the transformed Shizuma and reunite with Sarada and Iwabe before returning to the hotel . 32 `` The Quest for Souvenirs '' `` Omiyage kuesuto '' ( おみやげ ク 工 スト ) November 8 , 2017 After forgetting to get Himawari a souvenir - breaking a promise he made to her , Boruto must find a way to regain her faith in him . He promises her to retrieve his Kirigakure 's Water Cinnamon Sweets he `` misplaced '' . He proceeds to a shop recommended by Sarada and plays Shinobi Bout with the shop owner ; an old lady . Boruto can see her cards via the reflection on a shiny jar behind the old lady and decides to tell her about it , forfeiting from the game . The old lady ultimately gives Boruto the Sweets and he presents it to Himawari . 33 `` The Super Beast Scroll Slump ! '' `` Suranpu ! ! Chōjū giga '' ( スランプ ! ! 超 獣 偽 画 ) November 15 , 2017 From Inojin Yamanaka 's love of drawing since a young age , his signature technique , Super Beast Imitating Drawing , breathes life into pictures . However , one day he suddenly became unable to use that technique . The confused Inojin sought out his father , Sai , who uses the same technique , but Sai would not give him any advice . For some reason , Sai then recommends Inojin participate in a drawing competition aimed at children . Even though Inojin did well in the competition , Himawari ( Daughter of Naruto ) was announced as winner by Sai . Inojin decided to master his mom 's mind transfer justu and eventually succeed ; But , failed later . Inojin realized that he was not able to use the technique ( Super Beast Imitating Drawing ) , cause he lost some thing important to begin with . He accept Himawari as Master and try to learn what he lack in drawing . Finally Inojin realized that he lost his love towards drawing which caused him to lose his signature technique and overcome it with help of Boruto and Himawari . 34 `` The Night of The Shooting Stars '' `` Hoshi Furu Yoru '' ( 星 降る 夜 ) November 22 , 2017 When Boruto realizes that graduating from the academy could mark the end of his friendships , he organizes a camping trip to solidify their bonds . Meanwhile , Sakura teaches a skeptical Sarada about how long friendships can last . 35 `` The Parent Teacher Conference ! '' `` Sansha Mendan ... ! !

Schodt also stresses continuities of aesthetic style and vision between ukiyo - e and shunga woodblock prints and modern manga ( all three fulfill Eisner 's criteria for sequential art ) . While there are disputes over whether Chōjū - jinbutsu - giga or Shigisan - engi was the first manga , both scrolls date back to about the same time period .

Sir John Rhys put forth that it had been the `` Celtic New Year '' . He inferred it from contemporary folklore in Ireland and Wales , which he felt was `` full of Hallowe'en customs associated with new beginnings '' . He visited Mann and found that the Manx sometimes called 31 October `` New Year 's Night '' or Hog - unnaa . The Tochmarc Emire , written in the Middle Ages , reckoned the year around the four festivals at the beginning of the seasons , and put Samhain at the beginning of those . However , Hutton says that the evidence for it being the Celtic or Gaelic New Year 's Day is flimsy . Rhys 's theory was popularised by Sir James George Frazer , though at times he did acknowledge that the evidence is inconclusive . Frazer also put forth that Samhain had been the pagan Celtic festival of the dead and that it had been Christianized as All Saints and All Souls . Since then , Samhain has been popularly seen as the Celtic New Year and an ancient festival of the dead . The calendar of the Celtic League , for example , begins and ends at Samhain .", "The Roman Catholic holy day of All Saints ( or All Hallows ) was introduced in the year 609 , but was originally celebrated on 13 May . In 835 , Louis the Pious switched it to 1 November in the Carolingian Empire , at the behest of Pope Gregory IV . However , from the testimony of Pseudo-Bede , it is known that churches in what are now England and Germany were already celebrating All Saints on 1 November at the beginning of the 8th century . Thus , Louis merely made official the custom of celebrating it on 1 November . James Frazer suggests that 1 November was chosen because it was the date of the Celtic festival of the dead ( Samhain ) -- the Celts had influenced their English neighbours , and English missionaries had influenced the Germans . However , Ronald Hutton points out that , according to Óengus of Tallaght ( d . ca . 824 ) , the 7th / 8th century church in Ireland celebrated All Saints on 20 April . He suggests that the 1 November date was a Germanic rather than a Celtic idea . In the 11th century , 2 November became established as All Souls ' Day .

Giorno attempts to steal Koichi 's luggage , but is stopped by Koichi 's Stand , Echoes Act Three . Giorno recognized his power as being a Stand power similar to his Gold Experience , a Stand that can give life to inanimate objects . The story then follows Giorno as he tries to become a boss of the mafia in order to make Naples a better place and help its people , specifically where availability of drugs to young people are concerned . After an altercation with gang member Leaky Eye Luka , he attempts to join Passione , an organized crime group that employs many Stand users ( essentially , his vision for Passione is akin to Robin Hood 's band , in contrast to the sheer powerlust of its current leader ) . He is approached by a member of Passione , Bruno Bucciarati , who suspects him of killing Luka . During the fight readers are introduced to Buciarati 's Stand , Sticky Fingers , that can place and open a zipper on any surface . Bucciarati challenges Giorno to complete the rite to join Passione , and therefore visit the Capo , Polpo , in prison .", "2001", "The manga begins in 2001"], "bm25_ranks": [], "f1": 0, "p": 0, "r": 0, "em": 0.0, "t": 6.297999143600464}, {"question_id": "https://en.wikipedia.org//w/index.php?title=List_of_Disney_theatrical_animated_features&amp;oldid=837956774", "question": "when were all the disney princess movies made", "pred_answers": [], "gold_answers": ["Title Original theatrical release date Animation studio Academy Award Review of Walt Disney Cartoons 000000001937 -

He fervently supports traditional American values , is a Protestant , and is politically conservative . Mike loves his daughters but says his favorite is Eve , the youngest and most athletic daughter , and whose political opinions and interests mirror his own . He is proud of her ability to excel at anything she tries , including school work , hunting , and playing sports . Mike often finds himself annoyed with Outdoor Man 's young slow - witted employee Kyle , and with Ryan , his politically liberal son - in - law and the father of Mike 's grandson Boyd . The video blog or `` vlog '' that Mike does for Outdoor Man is frequently used as a vehicle to rant about his political views . Mike is a graduate of the University of Michigan , and an amateur radio operator using the call sign KA0XTT . Nancy Travis as Vanessa Baxter , Mike 's wife : Vanessa is a geologist working in the energy industry for a company that does hydraulic fracturing , or `` fracking '' . In season four , Vanessa becomes frustrated with her job and decides to become a high school science teacher . Vanessa was ambiguous in her political views until season five , when she announces she is supporting Hillary Clinton for president , mainly because she thinks it will advance women 's causes . She is also shown drinking wine frequently , and nearly as frequently mocked by Mike and her daughters about it . She is a graduate of Ohio State University . Vanessa has a tendency to put her foot in her mouth when around people of other races . Despite this , she and her African - American neighbor Carol Larabee seem to get along . Vanessa 's humor tends to include bad puns , which irritate Mike and the girls to no end . Amanda Fuller ( seasons 2 -- 6 ) and Alexandra Krosney ( season 1 ) as Kristin Beth Baxter , the oldest daughter : Kristin , unlike her father , espouses more liberal beliefs . During her senior year of high school , Kristin became pregnant with her son , Boyd . She was a single mother living in the Baxter home until moving out in the season two finale . She began to reconcile with Boyd 's father , Ryan , in season three , and the two get married between seasons four and five . Kristin worked at a diner until landing a job at an upscale restaurant run by a former co-worker at the end of season two . In season four , she becomes the manager of the new restaurant opened by Outdoor Man . Kristin tends to work extra hard in this new job to prove she did not get the position through nepotism , despite Mike and Ed frequently telling her she was qualified . Alexandra Krosney portrayed Kristin in the show 's first season ( despite being nearly two years younger than Molly Ephraim , playing Kristin 's younger sister ) ; Krosney was replaced by Amanda Fuller prior to season two for unspecified creative reasons . Molly Ephraim as Amanda Elaine `` Mandy '' Baxter - Anderson , the middle daughter : Mandy is nowhere near as intelligent as her sisters ( though her penchant for cutting class and ignoring homework might label her as voluntarily dumb ) , but excels in social situations . Interested in fashion ( and little else ) , she was one of the most popular girls at her high school . Mandy is very confident and creative , demonstrating traits found in her father . Unlike the rest of the family , she is lazy , conceited , selfish , insulting , and delinquent -- she drinks underage , ignores all driving laws , shoplifts from Outdoor Man , and has been caught staying out all night -- but occasionally displays moments of generosity and caring . She started dating Kyle in season 2 . As of season three , she is attending a local college and working at the diner where Kristin used to work . Later that same season , she begins an online clothing business , selling her self - designed fashions which she assembles in the basement of her parents ' house . Kyle asks her to marry him in season 5 , the 100th episode . She marries Kyle in season six , but they have yet to move out of the Baxter home . Up until she turned 21 , a running gag on the show was Mike , Vanessa , and occasionally Kristin snatching glasses of alcohol out of Mandy 's hand , usually followed by Mandy making a lame excuse . Kaitlyn Dever as Eve Baxter , the youngest daughter : Eve is an intelligent , athletic tomboy and generally has the same interests as Mike , including camping , sports , guns , and the military . She is Mike 's favorite daughter , and excels at her hobbies . She frequently outplays the boys in soccer and makes the boys ' football team as their placekicker . She is well aware of being the favorite over her two sisters . Eve has also inherited her father 's sense of humor , and her trademark sarcastic wit is frequently directed at clueless sister Mandy . Eve is an excellent student , whose only weak subject is art , though she did have to change math classes to escape a prejudiced teacher . Eve is a member of Army Junior ROTC and works toward gaining admittance to West Point . Her attempt to do so is unsuccessful , which seriously depresses her , so in season six , Eve decides to take a `` personal year '' rather than immediately attend college . She spends some of this time singing and playing guitar for money , but this proves to be unfruitful . During her gap year , Eve applies to the Air Force Academy in nearby Colorado Springs , and is accepted . Christoph Sanders as Kyle Anderson , a young employee at Outdoor Man : Kyle is universally recognized as a good guy . Kyle idolizes Mike , having grown up without a father figure . Kyle takes care of his grandmother who has dementia , and it is implied he grew up in her home . Kyle is often oblivious to social cues and is slow to catch on to the events happening around him . Kyle dated Kristin in season one and started dating Mandy in season two before proposing in season five , and marrying Mandy in season six . Héctor Elizondo as Edward `` Ed '' Alzate , Mike 's longtime boss : Ed started a bait and tackle shop many years ago and hired Mike , who helped turn the shop into the 20 - store Outdoor Man chain . Ed is perhaps fifteen years older than Mike , but the two men bond over similar outdoor hobbies and shared conservative values . Mike regularly talks to Ed about the happenings in his home and occasionally seeks advice . Having been divorced four times , Ed 's suggestions are rarely helpful . Ed is a Vietnam veteran , although he saw no combat in Vietnam , stating that he was a clerk in Saigon . He continues to help fellow veterans at the local Veterans of Foreign Wars hall with their Veteran Affairs paperwork . Ed is also a recurring target for jokes about his age and lack of hair , most often from Mike . It is revealed in season 6 that Ed has early onset dementia . Flynn Morrison ( regular , seasons 2 -- 6 ) and Evan and Luke Kruntchev ( recurring , season 1 ) as Boyd Baxter , Kristin 's son : Mike enjoys spending quality time with his grandson Boyd , and affectionately views him as the son he never had . Mike and Ryan often clash on how he should be raised . Boyd enjoys activities encouraged by both his father and grandfather . Jordan Masterson ( regular , seasons 2 -- 6 ) and Nick Jonas ( guest star , season 1 ) as Ryan Vogelson , Boyd 's Canadian father : Though Ryan initially fled when Kristin got pregnant , he returned to be involved in Boyd 's upbringing , and eventually the two reconciled and got engaged ( at the end of season 3 ) . Ryan holds liberal views , both politically and philosophically , and he and Mike routinely clash over their fundamentally opposing values , especially when it comes to child - rearing . Ryan wishes to raise his son without religion and patriotism , but neither Mike nor Kristin agree with this . His vegan diet , views on discipline , and what Mike sees as his oversensitivity are an affront to Mike 's beliefs , but Ryan generally enjoys being a thorn in Mike 's side . On rare occasions , Ryan and Mike agree on what is best for Boyd , but this usually puts them at odds with Kristin and / or Vanessa . Jonathan Adams as Chuck Larabee ( regular , seasons 4 -- 6 ; recurring , seasons 2 -- 3 ) , Mike and Vanessa 's neighbor : Chuck is a retired U.S. Marine and a veteran of the first Gulf War who runs a private security business and later takes charge of security for the Denver Outdoor Man . Chuck is an African - American , and often jokes with Mike about racial stereotypes , and they regularly exchange barbs as if they do n't like each other . In reality , they are good friends , despite being unwilling to admit it . Vanessa sees through their heated exchanges , often telling them to `` get a room '' . Chuck is married to Carol ( but the two do not always agree politically ) and they have a son , Brandon , who is the same age as Eve .", "Alexandra Krosney", "Molly Ephraim", "Amanda Fuller", "Kaitlyn Dever"], "bm25_ranks": [1], "f1": 0.0014224751066856333, "p": 0.5, "r": 0.0007122507122507123, "em": 0.0, "t": 5.664492607116699}, {"question_id": "https://en.wikipedia.org//w/index.php?title=Mount_Everest&amp;oldid=838344848", "question": "mount everest how did it get its name", "pred_answers": ["1952 Swiss Mount Everest Expedition."], "gold_answers": ["In 1865 , Everest was given its official English name by the Royal Geographical Society , upon a recommendation by Andrew Waugh , the British Surveyor General of India .

The Magna Carta and the United States Constitution also represents important milestones in the limiting of governmental power .

For instance , in North America a BAC of 0.1 ( 0.1 % or one tenth of one percent ) means that there are 0.10 g of alcohol for every 100 mL of blood .", "volume of blood", "There are several different units in use around the world for defining blood alcohol concentration . Each is defined as either a mass of alcohol per volume of blood or a mass of alcohol per mass of blood ( never a volume per volume ) . 1 milliliter of blood has a mass of approximately 1.06 grams . Because of this , units by volume are similar but not identical to units by mass . In the U.S. the concentration unit 1 % w / v ( percent mass / volume , equivalent to 10 g / l or 1 g per 100 ml ) is in use . This is not to be confused with the amount of alcohol measured on the breath , as with a breathalyzer . The amount of alcohol measured on the breath is generally accepted as proportional to the amount of alcohol present in the blood at a rate of 1 : 2100 . Therefore , a breathalyzer measurement of 0.10 mg / L of breath alcohol converts to 0.0001 × 2100 g / 10dL , or 0.021 g / dL of blood alcohol ( the units of the BAC in the United States ) .

During the next five years , eleven similar cases were reported in the medical literature , some of them already using the term Alzheimer 's disease .

It proscribes conduct perceived as threatening , harmful , or otherwise endangering to the property , health , safety , and moral welfare of people . Most criminal law is established by statute , which is to say that the laws are enacted by a legislature . It includes the punishment of people who violate these laws . Criminal law varies according to jurisdiction , and differs from civil law , where emphasis is more on dispute resolution and victim compensation than on punishment .", "Rehabilitation", "Deterrence", "Incapacitation", "Retribution", "Five objectives are widely accepted for enforcement of the criminal law by punishments : retribution , deterrence , incapacitation , rehabilitation and restoration . Jurisdictions differ on the value to be placed on each .", "proscribes conduct perceived as threatening , harmful , or otherwise endangering to the property , health , safety , and moral welfare of people", "Restoration", "Retribution -- Criminals ought to Be Punished in some way . This is the most widely seen goal . Criminals have taken improper advantage , or inflicted unfair detriment , upon others and consequently , the criminal law will put criminals at some unpleasant disadvantage to `` balance the scales . '' People submit to the law to receive the right not to be murdered and if people contravene these laws , they surrender the rights granted to them by the law . Thus , one who murders may be executed himself . A related theory includes the idea of `` righting the balance . '' Deterrence -- Individual deterrence is aimed toward the specific offender . The aim is to impose a sufficient penalty to discourage the offender from criminal behavior . General deterrence aims at society at large . By imposing a penalty on those who commit offenses , other individuals are discouraged from committing those offenses . Incapacitation -- Designed simply to keep criminals away from society so that the public is protected from their misconduct . This is often achieved through prison sentences today . The death penalty or banishment have served the same purpose . Rehabilitation -- Aims at transforming an offender into a valuable member of society . Its primary goal is to prevent further offense by convincing the offender that their conduct was wrong . Restoration -- This is a victim - oriented theory of punishment . The goal is to repair , through state authority , any injury inflicted upon the victim by the offender . For example , one who embezzles will be required to repay the amount improperly acquired . Restoration is commonly combined with other main goals of criminal justice and is closely related to concepts in the civil law , i.e. , returning the victim to his or her original position before the injury ."], "bm25_ranks": [], "f1": 0.10810810810810811, "p": 0.5, "r": 0.07407407407407407, "em": 0.0, "t": 6.068106174468994}, {"question_id": "https://en.wikipedia.org//w/index.php?title=Merit_badge_(Boy_Scouts_of_America)&amp;oldid=799461999", "question": "what badges do you need for eagle scout", "pred_answers": ["21 merit badges."], "gold_answers": ["Camping .

As her body is being carried off on a stretcher , one of her five adopted children , Jack , is fingerprinted and talks the crime over with his dad , Leo Argyll , at the police station . Jack is later beaten to death in prison and the family buries him . Eighteen months later , Leo Argyll is preparing to marry his secretary , Gwenda Vaughan . This sees the return of son Mickey to the house and the arrival of a strange visitor , Dr Arthur Calgary , who reveals that he gave a lift to Jack at the time that Rachel Argyll was murdered , thus proving belatedly Jack 's innocence . The delay in coming forward is explained away by Calgary being a physicist who has been in the Arctic on a research project . Later , whilst Calgary is sleeping in his hotel room , Mickey Argyll goes to question him and warn him off . At the hotel , Philip Durrant , the husband of Rachel 's eldest adopted daughter , joins Calgary for dinner to propose a plan to make money from Calgary 's revelation by selling the story to the newspapers . Durrant , a former Royal Air Force pilot who was disabled in a car crash , is shown as an abusive husband and a morphine addict . His wife Mary Durrant is also nasty to Tina Argyll and tells Gwenda that she will never replace her mother . `` Episode 2 '' Sandra Goldbacher Sarah Phelps 8 April 2018 ( 2018 - 04 - 08 ) TBD Dr Calgary revisits Sunny Point and is spotted by Hester before Mickey forces him into a car and drives him to a railway station . He assaults Calgary and firmly puts him on a train and tells him to leave . Whilst in motion , Calgary gets the train to stop in the middle of nowhere so he can get off and go back . Over breakfast at Sunny Point , Phillip antagonises everyone and causes many arguments between the siblings . He points out that trying to hide the new found evidence from Calgary , would look suspicious to the police . Calgary later telephones the house with the housemaid , Kirsten , picking up the phone at the same time as Leo Argyll . Calgary informs Argyll that he is going to the police with Kirsten overhearing it all but saying nothing . Whilst Calgary is walking on the road , he is stopped by Bellamy Gould , Chief Constable and friend of Leo Argyll , who is driving a car . Gould questions Calgary 's statement and seems to leave only to turn around and try to run Calgary down . Gould dies in trying , but Calgary survives . Calgary eventually gets a fair hearing form Leo Argyll and stays overnight at the house giving his version of events over dinner . The four remaining Argyll siblings meet later that night in the woods and argue about where they all were on the night of Rachel 's murder and bicker in a display of sibling rivalry with Mary Durrant appearing as the most upset by events and how she feels the other children spoilt her relationship with Rachel . Near the end of the episode , Phillip Durrant is trying to leave the house when he hears footsteps behind him , he turns and says `` of course it 's you ! '' . In the morning , Calgary reveals he wrote a detonation formula for the bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki , this led him to go mad and be detained against his will at an asylum , not away at the Arctic , as he claimed in the first episode . On the night that Rachel died , he escaped and gave a lift to Jack . At breakfast , Calgary mentions that the shower in the Durrant 's room has been going for some time . Leo Argyll and Calgary go to investigate and find Phillip Durrant dead on the floor of the shower with a hypodermic needle in his arm . `` Episode 3 '' Sandra Goldbacher Sarah Phelps 15 April 2018 ( 2018 - 04 - 15 ) 5.5 million This episode runs over a very short time period but has flashbacks for all the characters and details their reasons for possibly being the killer of Rachel . Hester runs away from the house and when Rachel tracks her down , she drugs her and takes her to hospital where she instructs the doctor to terminate the pregnancy . Jack witnesses Mickey and Tina in a passionate embrace and uses this against Rachel . Later we see Rachel telling Tina that she is filth . When Rachel goes into Leo 's study and discovers women 's underwear on the floor , she goes to the very top floor of the house and catches Leo and Gwenda on the bed . She informs Gwenda that Leo has a habit of sleeping with the staff and that she is not the first . Gwenda retaliates in kind and Rachel smacks her across the face . Rachel tells Leo she is divorcing him and through the conversation , it is understood that the money is in her name and he will be penniless . When she leaves Leo 's study , she is confronted by Mary who is upset that Rachel does not love her . Rachel tells her that she only adopted her because she was sad , and that it was n't Mary 's fault she could not stop her sadness . Jack witnesses this and is aghast , so he confronts his mother and she in turn tells him he is the son of Kirsten , the cook . Jack goes go see Kirsten and through another flashback , Jack is shown in the police station telling Leo that he knows that Leo is his father and that Kirsten is his mother . He tells Leo acidly that he will destroy him and ruin his life . Rachel is then shown being hit on the head with an Egyptian statuette by Leo and soon afterwards , Kirsten goes in to confront her about telling Jack of his parentage . Rachel dies in Kirsten 's arms and the policeman , Gould , conspires with Leo to have Jack killed in prison . After Phillip is discovered dead , Leo has Calgary taken away to the asylum and Leo is confronted by his children and Kirsten who show him the statuette as the murder weapon , not the decanter that had Jack 's fingerprints on it . Later , Gwenda and the four remaining children are shown on the dock by the lake dressed up for the wedding , but with police divers searching the lake . Gwenda is asking why Leo has killed himself . Later , Leo is shown waking up in the bunker underneath the house and pleading to be let out whilst Kirsten walks way smiling .", "Ordeal by Innocence is a three part BBC drama that was first broadcast during April 2018 .

But Walter Lord 's book A Night to Remember popularised wireless operator Harold Bride 's 1912 account ( New York Times ) that he heard the song `` Autumn '' before the ship sank . It is considered Bride either meant the hymn tune known as `` Autumn '' or the tune of the then - popular waltz `` Songe d'Automne '' but neither was in the White Star Line songbook for the band . Bride is one of only two witnesses who were close enough to the band , as he floated off the deck before the ship went down . Some consider his statement to be reliable . Mrs. Dick had left by lifeboat an hour and 20 minutes earlier and could not possibly have heard the band 's final moments . The notion that the band played `` Nearer , My God , to Thee '' as a swan song is possibly a myth originating from the wrecking of SS Valencia , which had received wide press coverage in Canada in 1906 and so may have influenced Mrs. Dick 's recollection ."], "bm25_ranks": [15], "f1": 1.0, "p": 1.0, "r": 1.0, "em": 1.0, "t": 5.650127649307251}, {"question_id": "https://en.wikipedia.org//w/index.php?title=Jack_Lord&amp;oldid=807042729", "question": "who played the original steve mcgarrett on hawaii five-o", "pred_answers": ["(Jack Lord)"], "gold_answers": ["John Joseph Patrick Ryan ( December 30 , 1920 -- January 21 , 1998 ) , best known by his stage name , Jack Lord , was an American television , film and Broadway actor and director and producer .

In after - dinner conversation at his home near Versailles , Laboulaye , an ardent supporter of the Union in the American Civil War , is supposed to have said : `` If a monument should rise in the United States , as a memorial to their independence , I should think it only natural if it were built by united effort -- a common work of both our nations . '' The National Park Service , in a 2000 report , however , deemed this a legend traced to an 1885 fundraising pamphlet , and that the statue was most likely conceived in 1870 . In another essay on their website , the Park Service suggested that Laboulaye was minded to honor the Union victory and its consequences , `` With the abolition of slavery and the Union 's victory in the Civil War in 1865 , Laboulaye 's wishes of freedom and democracy were turning into a reality in the United States . In order to honor these achievements , Laboulaye proposed that a gift be built for the United States on behalf of France . Laboulaye hoped that by calling attention to the recent achievements of the United States , the French people would be inspired to call for their own democracy in the face of a repressive monarchy .
