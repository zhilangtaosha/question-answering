force In electromagnetism and electronics, electromotive force (emf, denoted formula_1 and measured in volts), is the electrical action produced by a non-electrical source. Devices (known as \"transducers\") provide an emf by converting other forms of energy into electrical energy, such as batteries (which convert chemical energy) or generators (which convert mechanical energy). Sometimes an analogy to water pressure is used to describe electromotive force. (The word \"force\" in this case is not used to mean forces of interaction between bodies).

In the early 20th century researchers realized that greenhouse gases in the atmosphere made Earth's overall temperature higher than it would be without them. During the late 20th century, a scientific consensus evolved that increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere cause a substantial rise in global temperatures and changes to other parts of the climate system, with consequences for the environment and for human health.", "bm25_score": 16.744585, "bm25_rank": 627, "dpr_score": 75.1088638305664, "dpr_rank": 13, "reader_rank": 3, "pred_answer": "infrared", "pred_answer_prob": 0.00015171626282899775, "pred_answer_start": 190, "pred_answer_end": 198, "wiki_doc_id": "21350772"}], "f1": 0, "p": 0, "r": 0, "em": 0.0, "t": 19.889792919158936}, {"question_id": 166899, "question": "In 1995 it was moved to avoid Kiribati", "pred_answers": [], "gold_answers": ["International Date Line"], "bm25_ranks": [0, 1, 2, 8, 14, 15, 17, 408, 27, 30, 35, 173, 174, 49, 57, 702, 447, 67, 68, 69, 462, 207, 720, 980, 990, 101, 231, 489, 751], "dense_ranks": [0, 1, 96, 15, 43, 58, 206, 813, 13, 163, 19, 313, 24, 140, 306, 457, 417, 22, 136, 123, 53, 434, 48, 132, 314, 188, 143, 171, 191], "top_docs": [], "f1": 0, "p": 0, "r": 0, "em": 0.0, "t": 19.528568506240845}, {"question_id": 38557, "question": "(Jon of the Clue Crew indicates a map of the Western Mediterranean on the monitor.)

Acute atrophic candidiasis may feel like the mouth has been scalded with a hot liquid. Another potential symptom is a metallic, acidic, salty or bitter taste in the mouth. The pseudomembranous type rarely causes any symptoms apart from possibly some discomfort or bad taste due to the presence of the membranes. Sometimes the patient describes the raised pseudomembranes as \"blisters.\" Occasionally there can be dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), which indicates that the candidiasis involves the oropharynx or the esophagus, as well as the", "bm25_score": 28.392462, "bm25_rank": 38, "dpr_score": 66.58812713623047, "dpr_rank": 18, "reader_rank": 0, "pred_answer": "pseudomembranous type", "pred_answer_prob": 0.004967539835433647, "pred_answer_start": 330, "pred_answer_end": 351, "wiki_doc_id": "878898"}], "f1": 0, "p": 0, "r": 0, "em": 0.0, "t": 18.951082468032837}, {"question_id": 100901, "question": "If May Day falls on a Sunday, this holiday is the very next Sunday", "pred_answers": [], "gold_answers": ["Mother\\'s Day"], "bm25_ranks": [512, 637, 136, 904, 10, 266, 524, 13, 269, 527, 144, 400, 653, 767, 783, 149, 278, 151, 152, 153, 408, 663, 794, 286, 806, 39, 679, 684, 173, 47, 304, 687, 182, 695, 185, 570, 187, 697, 831, 832, 321, 578, 451, 705, 326, 200, 456, 75, 78, 335, 336, 213, 341, 342, 343, 727, 856, 738, 227, 229, 618, 110, 751, 752, 245, 631, 124, 509, 639], "dense_ranks": [484, 431, 191, 679, 69, 574, 450, 54, 526, 536, 122, 220, 508, 442, 725, 348, 183, 66, 250, 448, 406, 478, 596, 504, 447, 65, 458, 723, 312, 71, 307, 287, 430, 558, 176, 284, 830, 340, 343, 524, 580, 324, 489, 209, 351, 833, 627, 189, 338, 415, 383, 26, 330, 776, 632, 403, 667, 515, 525, 197, 41, 493, 207, 297, 427, 421, 150, 686, 195], "top_docs": [], "f1": 0, "p": 0, "r": 0, "em": 0.0, "t": 19.811545372009277}, {"question_id": 79021, "question": "(Leonard Maltin reads the clue.)

On 6 December 2006 NASA released photos of two craters in Terra Sirenum and Centauri Montes which appear to show the presence of flowing water on Mars at some point between 1999 and 2001. The pictures were produced by \"Mars Global Surveyor\" and are quite possibly the spacecraft's final contribution to our knowledge of Mars and the question of whether water exists on the planet. Hundreds of gullies were discovered that were formed from liquid water, possible in recent times. These gullies occur on steep slopes and mostly in certain bands of latitude.
